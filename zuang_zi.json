    "Hsiao-yao Yu, or 'Enjoyment in Untroubled Ease.'": "1. In the Northern Ocean there is a fish, the name of which is Khwan,—I do not know how many li in size. It changes into a bird with the name \nof Phing, the back of which is (also)—I do not know how many li in extent. When \nthis bird rouses itself and flies, its wings are like clouds all round the sky. When the \nsea is moved (so as to bear it along), it prepares to remove to the Southern Ocean. The \nSouthern Ocean is the Pool of Heaven.There is the (book called) Khi Hsieh,—a record of marvels. We have in it these words:—'When the phang \nis removing to the Southern Ocean it flaps (its wings) on the water for 3000 li. Then \nit ascends on a whirlwind 90,000 li, and it rests only at the end of six months.' (But \nsimilar to this is the movement of the breezes which we call) the horses of the fields, \nof the dust (which quivers in the sunbeams), and of living things as they are blown against \none another by the air. \nIs its azure the proper colour of the sky? Or is it occasioned by its distance and illimitable \nextent? If one were looking down (from above), the very same appearance would just meet \nhis view.2. And moreover, (to speak of) the accumulation of water;—if it be not great, it \nwill not have strength to support a large boat. Upset a cup of water in a cavity, and \na straw will float on it as if it were a boat. Place a cup in it, and it will stick fast;—the \nwater is shallow and the boat is large. (So it is with) the accumulation of wind; if it \nbe not great, it will not have strength to support great wings. Therefore (the phang ascended \nto) the height of 90,000 li, and there was such a mass of wind beneath it; thenceforth \nthe accumulation of wind was sufficient. As it seemed to bear the blue sky on its back, \nand there was nothing to obstruct or arrest its course, it could pursue its way to the \nSouth.A cicada and a little dove laughed at it, saying, 'We make an effort and fly towards an \nelm or sapan-wood tree; and sometimes before we reach it, we can do no more but drop to \nthe ground. Of what use is it for this (creature) to rise 90,000 li, and make for the \nSouth?' He who goes to the grassy suburbs, returning to the third meal (of the day), will have his belly as full as when \nhe set out; he who goes to a distance of 100 li will have to pound his grain where he \nstops for the night; he who goes a thousand li, will have to carry with him provisions \nfor three months. What should these two small creatures know about the matter? The knowledge \nof that which is small does not reach to that which is great; (the experience of) a few \nyears does not reach to that of many. How do we know that it is so? The mushroom of a \nmorning does not know (what takes place between) the beginning and end of a month; the \nshort-lived cicada does not know (what takes place between) the spring and autumn. These \nare instances of a short term of life. In the south of Khu, there is the (tree) called Ming-ling, whose spring is 500 years, and its autumn the same; in high antiquity there \nwas that called Ta-khu, \nwhose spring was 8000 years, and its autumn the same. And Phang \nZu is the one man renowned \nto the present day for his length of life:—if all men were (to wish) to match him, \nwould they not be miserable?3. In the questions put by Thang to Ki we have similar statements:—'In the bare and barren north there is the dark \nand vast ocean,—the Pool of Heaven. In it there is a fish, several thousand li in \nbreadth, while no one knows its length. Its name is the khwan. There is (also) a bird \nnamed the phang; its back is like the Thai mountain, while its wings are like clouds all \nround the sky. On a whirlwind it mounts upwards as on the whorls of a goat's horn for \n90,000 li, till, far removed from the cloudy vapours, it bears on its back the blue sky, \nand then it shapes its course for the South, and proceeds to the ocean there.' A quail \nby the side of a marsh laughed at it, and said, 'Where is it going to? I spring up with \na bound, and come down again when I have reached but a few fathoms, and then fly about \namong the brushwood and bushes; and this is the perfection of \nflying. Where is that creature going to?' This shows the difference between the small \nand the great.Thus it is that men, whose wisdom is sufficient for the duties of some one office, or \nwhose conduct will secure harmony in some one district, or whose virtue is befitting a \nruler so that they could efficiently govern some one state, are sure to look on themselves \nin this manner (like the quail), and yet Yung Tzu of Sung  would have smiled \nand laughed at them. (This Yung Tzu), though the whole world should have praised him, \nwould not for that have stimulated himself to greater endeavour, and though the whole \nworld should have condemned him, would not have exercised any more repression of his course; \nso fixed was he in the difference between the internal (judgment of himself) and the external \n(judgment of others), so distinctly had he marked out the bounding limit of glory and \ndisgrace. Here, however, he stopped. His place in the world indeed had become indifferent \nto him, but still he had not planted himself firmly (in the right position).There was Lieh Tzu, who \nrode on the wind and pursued his way, with an admirable indifference (to all external things), returning, however, after fifteen days, (to his place). In regard \nto the things that (are supposed to) contribute to happiness, he was free from all endeavours \nto obtain them; but though he had not to walk, there was still something for which he \nhad to wait. But suppose one who mounts on (the ether of) heaven and earth in its normal \noperation, and drives along the six elemental energies of the changing (seasons), thus \nenjoying himself in the illimitable,—what has he to wait for'? Therefore it is said, \n'The Perfect man has no (thought of) self; the Spirit-like man, none of merit; the Sagely-minded \nman, none of fame.'4. Yao, proposing to \nresign the throne to Hsu Yu, \nsaid, 'When the sun and moon have come forth, if the torches have not been put out, would \nit not be difficult for them to give light? When the seasonal rains are coming down, if \nwe still keep watering the ground, will not our toil be labour lost for all the good it \nwill do? Do you, Master, stand forth (as sovereign), and the kingdom will (at once) be \nwell governed. If I still (continue to) preside over it, I must look on myself as vainly \noccupying the place;—I beg to resign the throne to you.' Hsu Yu said, 'You, Sir, govern the kingdom, and the kingdom is well governed. If I in these \ncircumstances take your place, shall I not be doing so for the sake of the name? But the \nname is but the guest of the reality;—shall I be playing the part of the guest? \nThe tailor-bird makes its nest in the deep forest, but only uses a single branch; the \nmole drinks from the \nHo, but only takes what fills its belly. Return and rest in being ruler,—I will \nhave nothing to do with the throne. Though the cook were not attending to his kitchen, \nthe representative of the dead and the officer of prayer would not leave their cups and \nstands to take his place.'5. Kien Wu asked Lien \nShu, saying, 'I heard Khieh-yu talking words which were great, but had nothing corresponding to them (in reality);—once \ngone, they could not be brought back. I was frightened by them;—they were like the \nMilky Way which cannot \nbe traced to its beginning or end. They had no connexion with one another, and were not \nakin to the experiences of men.' 'What were his words?' asked Lien Shift, and the other \nreplied, (He said) that 'Far away on the hill of Ku-shih there dwelt a Spirit-like man whose flesh and skin were (smooth) \nas ice and (white) as snow; that his manner was elegant and delicate as that of a virgin; \nthat he did not eat any of the five grains, but inhaled the wind and drank the dew; that \nhe mounted on the clouds, drove along the flying dragons, rambling and enjoying himself \nbeyond the four seas; that by the concentration of his spirit-like powers he could save \nmen from disease and pestilence, and secure every year a plentiful harvest.' These words \nappeared to me wild and incoherent and I did not believe them. 'So it is,' said Lien Shu. \n'The blind have no perception of the beauty of elegant figures, nor the deaf of the sound \nof bells and drums. But is it only the bodily senses of which deafness and blindness can \nbe predicated? There is also a similar defect in the intelligence; and of this your words \nsupply an illustration in yourself. That man, with those attributes, though all things \nwere one mass of confusion, and he heard in that condition the whole world crying out \nto him to be rectified, would not have to address himself laboriously to the task, as \nif it were his business to rectify the world. Nothing could hurt that man; the greatest \nfloods, reaching to the sky, could not drown him, nor would he feel the fervour of the \ngreatest heats melting metals and stones till they flowed, and scorching all the ground \nand hills. From the dust and chaff of himself, he could still mould and fashion Yaos and \nShuns;how should he be \nwilling to occupy himself with things?'6. A man of Sung, who dealt in the ceremonial caps (of Yin), \nwent with them to Yueh, \nthe people of which cut off their hair and tattooed their bodies, so that they had no \nuse for them. Yao ruled the people of the kingdom, and maintained a perfect government \nwithin the four seas. Having gone to see the four (Perfect) Ones on the distant hill of Ku-shih, when (he returned to his capital) on the south of the \nFan water, his throne \nappeared no more to his deep-sunk oblivious eyes.7. Hui Tzu told Chuang \nTzu, saying, 'The king of Wei sent me some seeds of a large calabash, which I sowed. The fruit, when fully grown, could \ncontain five piculs (of anything). I used it to contain water, but \nit was so heavy that I could not lift it by myself. I cut it in two to make the parts \ninto drinking vessels; but the dried shells were too wide and unstable and would not hold \n(the liquor); nothing but large useless things! Because of their uselessness I knocked \nthem to pieces.' Chuang Tzu replied, 'You were indeed stupid, my master, in the use of \nwhat was large. There was a man of Sung who was skilful at making a salve which kept the \nhands from getting chapped; and (his family) for generations had made the bleaching of \ncocoon-silk their business. A stranger heard of it, and proposed to buy the art of the \npreparation for a hundred ounces of silver. The kindred all came together, and considered \nthe proposal. \"We have,\" said they, \"been bleaching cocoon-silk for generations, and have \nonly gained a little money. Now in one morning we can sell to this man our art for a hundred \nounces;—let him have it.\" The stranger accordingly got it and went away with it \nto give counsel to the king of Wu, \nwho was then engaged in hostilities with Yueh. The king gave him the command of his fleet, \nand in the winter he had an engagement with that of Yueh, on which he inflicted a great \ndefeat, and was invested \nwith a portion of territory taken from Yueh. The keeping the hands from getting chapped \nwas the same in both cases; but in the one case it led to the investiture (of the possessor \nof the salve), and in the other it had only enabled its owners \nto continue their bleaching. The difference of result was owing to the different use made \nof the art. Now you, Sir, had calabashes large enough to hold five piculs;—why did \nyou not think of making large bottle-gourds of them, by means of which you could have \nfloated over rivers and lakes, instead of giving yourself the sorrow of finding that they \nwere useless for holding anything. Your mind, my master, would seem to have been closed \nagainst all intelligence!'Hui Tzu said to Chuang Tzu, 'I have a large tree, which men call the Ailantus. \nIts trunk swells out to a large size, but is not fit for a carpenter to apply his line \nto it; its smaller branches are knotted and crooked, so that the disk and square cannot \nbe used on them. Though planted on the wayside, a builder would not turn his head to look \nat it. Now your words, Sir, are great, but of no use;—all unite in putting them \naway from them.' Chuang Tzu replied, 'Have you never seen a wildcat or a weasel? There \nit lies, crouching and low, till the wanderer approaches; east and west it leaps about, \navoiding neither what is high nor what is low, till it is caught in a trap, or dies in \na net. Again there is the Yak, \nso large that it is like a cloud hanging in the sky. It is large indeed, but it cannot \ncatch mice. You, Sir, have a large tree and are troubled because it is of no use;—why \ndo you not plant it in a tract where there is nothing else, or in a wide and barren wild? \nThere you might saunter idly by its side, or in the enjoyment \nof untroubled case sleep beneath it. Neither bill nor axe would shorten its existence; \nthere would be nothing to injure it. What is there in its uselessness to cause you distress?'"

    "BOOK II. KHÎ WÛ LUN.": "\n'Dreams, where thought, in fancy's maze, runs mad.'\n\n1. Nan-kwo Sze-khi was \nseated, leaning forward on his stool. He was looking up to heaven and breathed gently, \nseeming to be in a trance, and to have lost all consciousness of any companion. (His disciple), \nYen Khang Dze-yu, who \nwas in attendance and standing before him, said, 'What is this? Can the body be made to \nbecome thus like a withered tree, and the mind to become like slaked lime? His appearance \nas he leans forward on the stool to-day is such as I never saw him have before in the \nsame position.' Dze-khi said, 'Yen, you do well to ask such a question, I had just now \nlost myself; but how \nshould you understand it? You of Man, but have not heard those of Earth; you may have heard the notes of \nEarth, but have not heard those of Heaven.' \n\nDze-yu said, 'I venture to ask from you a description of all these.' The reply was, 'When \nthe breath of the Great Mass (of nature) comes strongly, it is called Wind. Sometimes \nit does not come so; but when it does, then from a myriad apertures there issues its excited \nnoise;—have you not heard it in a prolonged gale? Take the projecting bluff of a \nmountain forest;—in the great trees, a hundred spans round, the apertures and cavities \nare like the nostrils, or the mouth, or the ears; now square, now round like a cup or \na mortar; here like a wet footprint, and there like a large puddle. (The sounds issuing \nfrom them are like) those of fretted water, of the arrowy whizz, of the stern command, \nof the inhaling of the breath, of the shout, of the gruff note, of the deep wail, of the \nsad and piping note. The first notes are slight, and those that follow deeper, but in \nharmony with them. Gentle winds produce a small response; violent winds a great one. When \nthe fierce gusts have passed away, all the apertures  are empty \n(and still);—have you not seen this in the bending and quivering of the branches \nand leaves?' \n\nDze-yu said, 'The notes of Earth then are simply those which come from its myriad apertures; \nand the notes of Man may just be compared to those which (are brought from the tubes of) \nbamboo;—allow me to ask about the notes of Heaven.' Dze-khi replied, 'When (the wind) blows, (the sounds from) the myriad apertures \nare different, and (its cessation) makes them stop of themselves. Both of these things \narise from (the wind and the apertures) themselves:—should there be any other agency \nthat excites them?' \n\n2. Great knowledge is wide and comprehensive; small knowledge is partial and restricted. \nGreat speech is exact and complete; small speech is (merely) so much talk. When we sleep, the soul communicates with (what is external to us); when we \nawake, the body is set free. Our intercourse with others then leads to various activity, \nand daily there is the striving of mind with mind. There are hesitancies; deep difficulties; \nreservations; small apprehensions causing restless distress, and great  \napprehensions producing endless fears. Where their utterances are like arrows from a bow, \nwe have those who feel it their charge to pronounce what is right and what is wrong.; \nwhere they are given out like the conditions of a covenant, we have those who maintain \ntheir views, determined to overcome. (The weakness of their arguments), like the decay \n(of things) in autumn and winter, shows the failing (of the minds of some) from day to \nday; or it is like their water which, once voided, cannot be gathered up again. Then their \nideas seem as if fast bound with cords, showing that the mind is become like an old and \ndry moat, and that it is nigh to death, and cannot be restored to vigour and brightness. \n\nJoy and anger, sadness and pleasure, anticipation and regret, fickleness and fixedness, \nvehemence and indolence, eagerness and tardiness;—(all these moods), like music \nfrom an empty tube, or mushrooms from the warm moisture, day and night succeed to one \nanother and come before us, and we do not know whence they sprout. Let us stop! Let us \nstop! Can we expect to find out suddenly how they are produced? \n\nIf there were not (the views of) another, I should not have mine; if there were not I \n(with my views), his would be uncalled for:—this is nearly a true, statement of \nthe case, but we do not know what it is that makes it be so. It might seem as if there \nwould be a true Governor \nconcerned in it, but we do not find  any trace (of his presence \nand acting). That such an One could act so I believe; but we do not see His form. He has \naffections, but He has no form. \n\nGiven the body, with its hundred parts, its nine openings, and its six viscera, all complete \nin their places, which do I love the most? Do you love them all equally? or do you love \nsome more than others? Is it not the case that they all perform the part of your servants \nand waiting women? All of them being such, are they not incompetent to rule one another? \nor do they take it in turns to be now ruler and now servants? There must be a true Ruler \n(among them) whether by \nsearching you can find out His character or not, there is neither advantage nor hurt, \nso far as the truth of His operation is concerned. When once we have received the bodily \nform complete, its parts do not fail to perform their functions till the end comes. In \nconflict with things or in harmony with them, they pursue their course to the end, with \nthe speed of a galloping horse which cannot be stopped;—is it not sad? To be constantly \ntoiling all one's lifetime, without seeing the fruit of one's labour, and to be weary \nand worn out with his labour, without knowing where he is going to:—is it not a \ndeplorable case? Men may say, 'But it is not death;' yet of what advantage is this? When \nthe body is decomposed, the mind will be the same along with it:—must not the case \nbe pronounced very deplorable? \nIs the life  of man indeed enveloped in such darkness? Is it \nI alone to whom it appears so? And does it not appear to be so to other men? \n\n3. If we were to follow the judgments of the predetermined mind, who would be left alone \nand without a teacher? \nNot only would it be so with those who know the sequences (of knowledge and feeling) and \nmake their own selection among them, but it would be so as well with the stupid and unthinking. \nFor one who has not this determined mind, to have his affirmations and negations is like \nthe case described in the saying, 'He went to Yueh to-day, and arrived at it yesterday.' \nIt would be making what was not a fact to be a fact. But even the spirit-like Yu \ncould not have known how to do this, and how should one like me be able to do it? \n\nBut speech is not like the blowing (of the wind) the speaker has (a meaning in) his words. \nIf, however, what he says, be indeterminate (as from a mind not made up), does he then \nreally speak or not? He thinks that his words are different from the chirpings of fledgelings; \nbut is there any distinction between them or not? But how can the Tao be so obscured, \nthat there should be 'a True' and 'a False' in it? How can speech be so obscured that \nthere should be 'the Right' and 'the Wrong' about them? Where shall the Tao go to that \nit will not  be found? Where shall speech be found that it will \nbe inappropriate? Tao becomes obscured through the small comprehension (of the mind), \nand speech comes to be obscure through the vain-gloriousness (of the speaker). So it is \nthat we have the contentions between the Literati \nand the Mohists, the \none side affirming what the other denies, and vice versa. If we would decide on their \nseveral affirmations and denials, no plan is like bringing the (proper) light (of the \nmind) to bear on them. \n\nAll subjects may be looked at from (two points of view),—from that and from this. \nIf I look at a thing from another's point of view, I do not see it; only as I know it \nmyself, do I know it. Hence it is said, 'That view comes from this; and this view is a \nconsequence of that:'—which is the theory that that view and this—(the opposite \nviews)—produce each the other. \nAlthough it be so, there is affirmed now life and now death; now death and now life; now \nthe admissibility of a thing and now its inadmissibility; now its inadmissibility and \nnow its admissibility. (The disputants) now affirm and now deny; now deny and now affirm. \nTherefore sagely man does not pursue this method, but views things in the light of (his) \nHeaven (-ly nature), \nand hence forms his judgment of what is right. \n\nThis view is the same as that, and that view is the same as this. But that view involves \nboth a right and a wrong; and this view involves also a right and a wrong:—are there \nindeed, or are there not the two views, that and this? They have not found their point \nof correspondency which is called the pivot of the Tao. As soon as one finds this pivot, \nhe stands in the centre of the ring (of thought), where he can respond without end to \nthe changing views;—without end to those affirming, and without end to those denying. \nTherefore I said, 'There is nothing like the proper light (of the mind).' \n\n4. By means of a finger (of my own) to illustrate that the finger (of another) is not \na finger is not so good a plan as to illustrate that it is not so by means of what is \n(acknowledged to be) not a finger; and by means of (what I call) a horse to illustrate \nthat (what another calls) a horse is not so, is not so good a plan as to illustrate that \nit is not a horse, by means of what is (acknowledged to be) not a horse. \n(All things in) heaven and earth may be (dealt with as) a finger; (each of) their myriads \nmay be (dealt with as) a horse. Does a thing seem so to me? (I say that) it is so. Does \nit seem not so to me? (I say that) it is not so. A path is formed by (constant)  \ntreading on the ground. A thing is called by its name through the (constant) application \nof the name to it. How is it so? It is so because it is so. How is it not so? It is not \nso, because it is not so. Everything has its inherent character and its proper capability. \nThere is nothing which has not these. Therefore, this being so, if we take a stalk of \ngrain and a (large) pillar, \na loathsome (leper) and (a beauty like) Hsi Shih, \nthings large and things insecure, things crafty and things strange;—they may in \nthe light of the Tao all be reduced to the same category (of opinion about them). \n\nIt was separation that led to completion; from completion ensued dissolution. But all \nthings, without regard to their completion and dissolution, may again be comprehended \nin their unity;—it is only the far reaching in thought who know how to comprehend \nthem in this unity. This being so, let us give up our devotion to our own views, and occupy \nourselves with the ordinary views. These ordinary views are grounded on the use of things. \n(The study of that) use leads to the comprehensive judgment, and that judgment secures \nthe success (of the inquiry). That success gained, we are near (to the object of our search), \nand there we stop. When we stop, and yet we do not know how it is so, we have what is \ncalled the Tao. \n\nWhen we toil our spirits and intelligence, obstinately  determined \n(to establish our own view), and do not know the agreement (which underlies it and the \nviews of others), we have what is called 'In the morning three.' What is meant by that \n'In the morning three?' A keeper of monkeys, in giving them out their acorns, (once) said, \n'In the morning I will give you three (measures) and in the evening four.' This made them \nall angry, and he said, 'Very well. In the morning I will give you four and in the evening \nthree.' His two proposals were substantially the same, but the result of the one was to \nmake the creatures angry, and of the other to make them pleased:—an illustration \nof the point I am insisting on. Therefore the sagely man brings together a dispute in \nits affirmations and denials, and rests in the equal fashioning of Heaven. \nBoth sides of the question are admissible. \n\n5. Among the men of old their knowledge reached the extreme point. What was that extreme \npoint? Some held that at first there was not anything. This is the extreme point, the \nutmost point to which nothing can be added. \nA second class held that there was something, but without any responsive recognition \nof it (on the part of men). \n\nA third class held that there was such recognition, but there had not begun to be any \nexpression of different opinions about it. \n\nIt was through the definite expression of different opinions about it that there ensued \ninjury to (the doctrine of) the Tao. It was this injury to the (doctrine of the) Tao which \nled to the formation of (partial) preferences. Was it indeed after such preferences were \nformed that the injury came? or did the injury precede the rise of such preferences? If \nthe injury arose after their formation, Kao's method of playing on the lute was natural. \nIf the injury arose before their formation, there would have been no such playing on the \nlute as Kao's. \n\nKao Wan's playing on the lute, Shih Kwang's indicating time with his staff, and Hui Tzu's \n(giving his views), while leaning against a dryandra tree (were all extraordinary). The \nknowledge of the three men (in their several arts) was nearly perfect, and therefore they \npractised them to the end of their lives. They loved them because they were different \nfrom those of others. They loved them and wished to make them known to others. But as \nthey could not be made clear, though they tried to make them so, they ended with the obscure \n(discussions) about 'the hard' and 'the White.' And their sons, \nmoreover, with all the threads of their fathers' compositions, yet to the end of their \nlives accomplished nothing. If they, proceeding in this way, could be said to have succeeded, \nthen am I also successful;  if they cannot be pronounced successful, \nneither I nor any other can succeed. \n\nTherefore the scintillations of light from the midst of confusion and perplexity are indeed \nvalued by the sagely man; but not to use one's own views and to take his position on the \nordinary views is what is called using the (proper) light. \n\n6. But here now are some other sayings:—I \ndo not know whether they are of the same character as those which I have already given, \nor of a different character. Whether they be of the same character or not when looked \nat along with them, they have a character of their own, which cannot be distinguished \nfrom the others. But though this be the case, let me try to explain myself. \n\nThere was a beginning. There was a beginning before that beginning. \nThere was a beginning previous to that beginning before there was the beginning. There \nwas existence; there had been no existence. There was no existence before the beginning \nof that no existence. There was no existence \nprevious to the no existence before there was the beginning of the no existence. If suddenly \nthere was nonexistence, we do not know whether it was really anything existing, or really \nnot existing. Now I have said what I have said, but I do not know whether what I have \nsaid be really anything to the point or not. \n\nUnder heaven there is nothing greater than the tip of an autumn down, and the Thai mountain \nis small. There is no one more long-lived than a child which dies prematurely, and Phang \nZu did not live out his time. Heaven, Earth, and I were produced together, and all things \nand I are one. Since they are one, can there be speech about them? But since they are \nspoken of as one, must there not be room for speech? One and Speech are two; two and one \nare three. Going on from this (in our enumeration), the most skilful reckoner cannot reach \n(the end of the necessary numbers), and how much less can ordinary people do so! Therefore \nfrom non-existence we proceed to existence till we arrive at three; proceeding from existence \nto existence, to how many should we reach? Let us abjure such procedure, and simply rest \nhere. \n\n7. The Tao at first met with no responsive recognition. Speech at first had no constant \nforms of expression. Because of this there came the demarcations (of different views). \nLet me describe those demarcations:—they are the Left and the Right; \nthe Relations and their Obligations; \nClassifications  \nand their Distinctions; Emulations and Contentions. These are what are called 'the Eight \nQualities.' Outside the limits of the world of men, \nthe sage occupies his thoughts, but does not discuss about anything; inside those limits \nhe occupies his thoughts, but does not pass any judgments. In the Khun Khiu, \nwhich embraces the history of the former kings, the sage indicates his judgments, but \ndoes not argue (in vindication of them). Thus it is that he separates his characters from \none another without appearing to do so, and argues without the form of argument. How does \nhe do so? The sage cherishes his views in his own breast, while men generally state theirs \nargumentatively, to show them to others. Hence we have the saying, 'Disputation is a proof \nof not seeing clearly.' \n\nThe Great Tao does not \nadmit of being praised. The Great Argument does not require words. Great Benevolence is \nnot (officiously) benevolent. Great Disinterestedness does not vaunt its humility. Great \nCourage is not seen in stubborn bravery. \n\nThe Tao that is displayed is not the Tao. Words that are argumentative do not reach the \npoint. Benevolence that is constantly exercised does not accomplish its object. Disinterestedness \nthat vaunts its purity is not genuine. Courage that is most stubborn  \nis ineffectual. These five seem to be round (and complete), but they tend to become square \n(and immovable). Therefore \nthe knowledge that stops at what it does not know is the greatest. Who knows the argument \nthat needs no words, and the Way that is not to be trodden? \n\nHe who is able to know this has what is called 'The Heavenly Treasure-house.' \nHe may pour into it without its being filled; he may pour from it without its being exhausted; \nand all the while he does not know whence (the supply) comes. This is what is called 'The \nStore of Light.' \n\nTherefore of old Yao asked Shun, saying, 'I wish to smite (the rulers of) Zung, Kwei, \nand Hsu-ao. Even when \nstanding in my court, I cannot get them out of my mind. How is it so?' Shun replied, 'Those \nthree rulers live (in their little states) as if they were among the mugwort and other \nbrushwood;—how is it that you cannot get them out of your mind? Formerly, ten suns \ncame out together, and all things were illuminated by them;—how much should (your) \nvirtue exceed (all) suns!' \n\n8. Nieh Khueh asked Wang I, \nsaying, 'Do you know, Sir, what all creatures agree in approving and  \naffirming?' 'How should I know it?' was the reply. 'Do you know what it is that you do \nnot know?' asked the other again, and he got the same reply. He asked a third time,—'Then \nare all creatures thus without knowledge?' and Wang I answered as before, (adding however), \n'Notwithstanding, I will try and explain my meaning. How do you know that when I say \"I \nknow it,\" I really (am showing that) I do not know it, and that when I say \"I do not know \nit,\" I really am showing that I do know it.' \nAnd let me ask you some questions:—'If a man sleep in a damp place, he will have \na pain in his loins, and half his body will be as if it were dead; but will it be so with \nan eel? If he be living in a tree, he will be frightened and all in a tremble; but will \nit be so with a monkey? And does any one of the three know his right place? Men eat animals \nthat have been fed on grain and grass; deer feed on the thickset grass; centipedes enjoy \nsmall snakes; owls and crows delight in mice; but does any one of the four know the right \ntaste? The dog-headed monkey finds its mate in the female gibbon; the elk and the axis \ndeer cohabit; and the eel enjoys itself with other fishes. Mao Zhiang \nand Li Ki were accounted by men to be most \nbeautiful, but when fishes saw them, they dived deep in the water from them; when birds, \nthey flew from them aloft; and  when deer saw them, they separated \nand fled away. But did \nany of these four know which in the world is the right female attraction? As I look at \nthe matter, the first principles of benevolence and righteousness and the paths of approval \nand disapproval are inextricably mixed and confused together:—how is it possible \nthat I should know how to discriminate among them?' \n\nNieh Khueh said (further), 'Since you, Sir, do not know what is advantageous and what \nis hurtful, is the Perfect man also in the same way without the knowledge of them?' Wang \ni replied, 'The Perfect man is spirit-like. Great lakes might be boiling about him, and \nhe would not feel their heat; the Ho and the Han might be frozen up, and he would not \nfeel the cold; the hurrying thunderbolts might split the mountains, and the wind shake \nthe ocean, without being able to make him afraid. Being such, he mounts on the clouds \nof the air, rides on the sun and moon, and rambles at ease beyond the four seas. Neither \ndeath nor life makes any change in him, and how much less should the considerations of \nadvantage and injury do so!' \n\n9. Khu Zhiao Tzu asked \nKhang-wu Dze, saying,  \n'I heard the Master (speaking of such language as the following):—\"The sagely man \ndoes not occupy himself with worldly affairs. He does not put himself in the way of what \nis profitable, nor try to avoid what is hurtful; he has no pleasure in seeking (for anything \nfrom any one); he does not care to be found in (any established) Way; he speaks without \nspeaking; he does not speak when he speaks; thus finding his enjoyment outside the dust \nand dirt (of the world).\" The Master considered all this to be a shoreless flow of mere \nwords, and I consider it to describe the course of the Mysterious Way.—What do you, \nSir, think of it?' Khang-wu dze replied, 'The hearing of such words would have perplexed \neven Hwang-Ti, and how should Khiu be competent to understand them? And you, moreover, \nare too hasty in forming your estimate (of their meaning). You see the egg, and (immediately) \nlook out for the cock (that is to be hatched from it); you see the bow, and (immediately) \nlook out for the dove (that is to be brought down by it) being roasted. I will try to \nexplain the thing to you in a rough way; do you in the same way listen to me. \n\n'How could any one stand by the side of the sun and moon, and hold under his arm all space \nand all time? (Such language only means that the sagely man) keeps his mouth shut, and \nputs aside questions that are uncertain and dark; making his inferior capacities unite \nwith him in honouring (the One Lord). Men in general bustle about and toil; the  \nsagely man seems stupid and to know nothing. \nHe blends ten thousand years together in the one (conception of time); the myriad things \nall pursue their spontaneous course, and they are all before him as doing so. \n\n'How do I know that the love of life is not a delusion? and that the dislike of death \nis not like a young person's losing his way, and not knowing that he is (really) going \nhome? Li Ki was a daughter \nof the border Warden of Ai. When (the ruler of) the state of Zin first got possession \nof her, she wept till the tears wetted all the front of her dress. But when she came to \nthe place of the king, \nshared with him his luxurious couch, and ate his grain-and-grass-fed meat, then she regretted \nthat she had wept. How do I know that the dead do not repent of their former craving for \nlife? \n\n'Those who dream of (the pleasures of) drinking may in the morning wail and weep; those \nwho dream of wailing and weeping may in the morning be going out to hunt. When they were \ndreaming they did not know it was a dream; in their dream they may even have tried to \ninterpret it; but when \nthey awoke they knew that it a dream. And  there is the great \nawaking, after which we shall know that this life was a great dream. \nAll the while, the stupid think they are awake, and with nice discrimination insist on \ntheir knowledge; now playing the part of rulers, and now of grooms. Bigoted was that Khiu! \nHe and you are both dreaming. I who say that you are dreaming am dreaming myself. These \nwords seem very strange; but if after ten thousand ages we once meet with a great sage \nwho knows how to explain them, it will be as if we met him (unexpectedly) some morning \nor evening. \n\n10. 'Since you made me enter into this discussion with you, if you have got the better \nof me and not I of you, are you indeed right, and I indeed wrong? If I have got the better \nof you and not you of me, am I indeed right and you indeed wrong? Is the one of us right \nand the other wrong? are we both right or both wrong? Since we cannot come to a mutual \nand common understanding, men will certainly continue in darkness on the subject. \n\n'Whom shall I employ to adjudicate in the matter? If I employ one who agrees with you, \nhow can he, agreeing with you, do so correctly? And the same may be said, if I employ \none who agrees with me. It will be the same if I employ one who differs from us both or \none who agrees with us both. In this way I and you and those others would all not be able \nto come to a mutual understanding; and shall we then wait for that (great sage)? (We need \nnot do so.) To wait on others to learn how conflicting opinions are changed is simply \nlike not so  waiting at all. The harmonising of them is to be \nfound in the invisible operation of Heaven, and by following this on into the unlimited \npast. It is by this method that we can complete our years (without our minds being disturbed). \n\n'What is meant by harmonising (conflicting opinions) in the invisible operation of Heaven? \nThere is the affirmation and the denial of it; and there is the assertion of an opinion \nand the rejection of it. If the affirmation be according to the reality of the fact, it \nis certainly different from the denial of it:—there can be no dispute about that. \nIf the assertion of an opinion be correct, it is certainly different from its rejection:—neither \ncan there be any dispute about that. Let us forget the lapse of time; let us forget the \nconflict of opinions. Let us make our appeal to the Infinite, and take up our position \nthere.' \n\n11. The Penumbra asked the Shadow, \nsaying, 'Formerly you were walking on, and now you have stopped; formerly you were sitting, \nand now you have risen up:—how is it that you are so without stability?' The Shadow \nreplied, 'I wait for the movements of something else to do what I do, and that something \nelse on which I wait waits further . \nMy waiting,—is it for the scales of a snake, or the wings of a cicada? \nHow should I know why I do one thing, or do not do another? \n\n'Formerly, I, Kwang Kau, dreamt that I was a butterfly, a butterfly flying about, feeling \nthat it was enjoying itself I did not know that it was Kau. Suddenly I awoke, and was \nmyself again, the veritable Kau. I did not know whether it had formerly been Kau dreaming \nthat he was a butterfly, or it was now a butterfly dreaming that it was Kau. But between \nKau and a butterfly there must be a difference. \nThis is a case of what is called the Transformation of Things.' \n"

    "BOOK III. YANG SHANG Kû.": "\n1. There is a limit to our life, but to knowledge there is no limit. With what is limited \nto pursue after what is unlimited is a perilous thing; and when, knowing this, we still \nseek the increase of our knowledge, the peril cannot be averted. There should not be the practice of what is good with any thought of the fame \n(which it will bring), nor of what is evil with any approximation to the punishment (which \nit will incur):—an \naccordance with the Central Element (of our nature) is the regular way to preserve the body, to maintain the life, to nourish our \nparents, and to complete our term of years. \n\n2. His cook was cutting \nup an ox for the ruler Wan-hui. Whenever he \napplied his hand, leaned forward with his shoulder, planted his foot, and employed  \nthe pressure of his knee, in the audible ripping off of the skin, and slicing operation \nof the knife, the sounds were all in regular cadence. Movements and sounds proceeded as \nin the dance of 'the Mulberry Forest' and the blended notes of 'the King Shau.' \nThe ruler said, 'Ah! Admirable! That your art should have become so perfect!' (Having \nfinished his operation), the cook laid down his knife, and replied to the remark, 'What \nyour servant loves is the method of the Tao, something in advance of any art. When I first \nbegan to cut up an ox, I saw nothing but the (entire) carcase. After three years I ceased \nto see it as a whole. Now I deal with it in a spirit-like manner, and do not look at it \nwith my eyes. The use of my senses is discarded, and my spirit acts as it wills. Observing \nthe natural lines, (my knife) slips through the great crevices and slides through the \ngreat cavities, taking advantage of the facilities thus presented. My art avoids the membranous \nligatures, and much more the great bones. \n\n'A good cook changes his knife every year;—(it may have been injured) in cutting; \nan ordinary cook changes his every month;—(it may have been) broken. Now my knife \nhas been in use for nineteen years; it has cut up several thousand oxen, and yet its edge \nis as sharp as if it had newly come from the whetstone. There are the interstices of the \njoints, and the edge of the knife has no (appreciable) thickness; when that which is so \nthin enters where the interstice is, how easily it moves along! The  \nblade has more than room enough. Nevertheless, whenever I come to a complicated joint, \nand see that there will be some difficulty, I proceed anxiously and with caution, not \nallowing my eyes to wander from the place, and moving my hand slowly. Then by a very slight \nmovement of the knife, the part is quickly separated, and drops like (a clod of) earth \nto the ground. Then standing up with the knife in my hand, I look all round, and in a \nleisurely manner, with an air of satisfaction, wipe it clean, and put it in its sheath.' \nThe ruler Wan-hui said, 'Excellent! I have heard the words of my cook, and learned from \nthem the nourishment of (our) life.' \n\n3. When Kung-wan Hsien \nsaw the Master of the Left, he was startled, and said, 'What sort of man is this? How \nis it he has but one foot? Is it from Heaven? or from Man?' Then he added, 'It must be from Heaven, and not from Man. Heaven's making of this man caused \nhim to have but one foot. In the person of man, each foot has its marrow. By this I know \nthat his peculiarity is from Heaven, and not from Man. A pheasant of the marshes has to \ntake ten steps to pick up a mouthful of food, and thirty steps to get a drink, but it \ndoes not seek to be nourished in a coop. Though its spirit would (there) enjoy a royal \nabundance, it does not think (such confinement) good.' \n\n4. When Lao Tan died, \nKhin Shih went to condole \n(with his son), but after crying out three times, he came out. The disciples \nsaid to him, 'Were you not a friend of the Master?' 'I was,' he replied, and they said, \n'Is it proper then to offer your condolences merely as you have done?' He said, 'It is. \nAt first I thought he was the man of men, and now I do not think so. When I entered a \nlittle ago and expressed my condolences, there were the old men wailing as if they had \nlost a son, and the young men wailing as if they had lost their mother. In his attracting \nand uniting them to himself in such a way there must have been that which made them involuntarily \nexpress their words (of condolence), and involuntarily wail, as they were doing. And this \nwas a hiding from himself of his Heaven (-nature), and an excessive indulgence of his \n(human) feelings;—a forgetting of what he had received (in being born); what the \nancients called the punishment due to neglecting the Heaven (-nature). \nWhen the Master came, \nit was at the proper time; when he went away, it was the simple sequence (of his coming). \nQuiet acquiescence in what happens at its proper time, and quietly submitting (to its \nceasing) afford no occasion for grief or for joy. \nThe ancients described (death) as the loosening of the  cord \non which God suspended (the life). \nWhat we can point to are the faggots that have been consumed; but the fire is transmitted \n(elsewhere), and we know not that it is over and ended. \n"

    "BOOK IV. ZÄN KIEN SHIH.": "\n1. Yen Hui went to see \nKung-ni, and asked leave \nto take his departure. 'Where are you going to?' asked the Master. 'I will go to Wei' was the reply. 'And with what object?' 'I have heard that the ruler of Wei is in the vigour of his years, and consults none but himself as to his course. \nHe deals with his state as if it were a light matter, and has no perception of his errors. \nHe thinks lightly of his people's dying; the dead are lying all over the country as if \nno smaller space could contain them; on the plains and about the marshes, they are as thick as heaps of fuel. The people know \nnot where to turn to. I have heard you, Master, say, \"Leave the state that is well  \ngoverned; go to the state where disorder prevails.\" At the door of a physician there are many who are ill. I wish through what \nI have heard (from you) to think out some methods (of dealing with Wei), if peradventure \nthe evils of the state may be cured.' \n\nKung-ni said, 'Alas! The risk is that you will go only to suffer in the punishment (of \nyourself)! The right method (in such a case) will not admit of any admixture. With such \nadmixture, the one method will become many methods. Their multiplication will embarrass \nyou. That embarrassment will make you anxious. However anxious you may be, you will not \nsave (yourself). The perfect men of old first had (what they wanted to do) in themselves, \nand afterwards they found (the response to it) in others. If what they wanted in themselves \nwas not fixed, what leisure had they to go and interfere with the proceedings of any tyrannous \nman? \n\n'Moreover, do you know how virtue is liable to be dissipated, and how wisdom proceeds \nto display itself? Virtue is dissipated in (the pursuit of) the name for it, and wisdom \nseeks to display itself in the striving with others. In the pursuit of the name men overthrow \none another; wisdom becomes a weapon of contention. Both these things are instruments \nof evil, and should not be allowed to have free course in one's conduct. Supposing one's \nvirtue to be great and his sincerity firm, if he do not comprehend the spirit of those \n(whom he wishes to influence); and supposing he is free from the  \ndisposition to strive for reputation, if he do not comprehend their, minds;—when \nin such a case he forcibly insists on benevolence and righteousness, setting them forth \nin the strongest and most direct language, before the tyrant, then he, hating (his reprover's) \npossession of those excellences, will put him down as doing him injury. He who injures \nothers is sure to be injured by them in return. You indeed will hardly escape being injured \nby the man (to whom you go)! \n\n'Further, if perchance he takes pleasure in men of worth and hates those of an opposite \ncharacter, what is the use of your seeking to make yourself out to be different (from \nsuch men about him)? Before you have begun to announce (your views), he, as king and ruler, \nwill take advantage of you, and immediately contend with you for victory. Your eyes will \nbe dazed and full of perplexity; you will try to look pleased with him; you will frame \nyour words with care; your demeanour will be conformed to his; you will confirm him in \nhis views. In this way you will be adding fire to fire, and water to water, increasing, \nas we may express it, the evils (which you deplore). To these signs of deferring to him \nat the first there will be no end. You will be in danger, seeing he does not believe you, \nof making your words more strong, and you are sure to die at the hands of such a tyrant. \n\n'And formerly Kieh killed \nKwan Lung-fang, and Kau \nkilled the prince Pi-kan. \nBoth of  these cultivated their persons, bending down in sympathy \nwith the lower people to comfort them suffering (as they did) from their oppressors, and \non their account opposing their superiors. On this account, because they so ordered their \nconduct, their rulers compassed their destruction:—such regard had they for their \nown fame. (Again), Yao anciently attacked (the states of) Zhung-kih \nand Hsu-ao, and Yu attacked the ruler of Hu. \nThose states were left empty, and with no one to continue their population, the people \nbeing exterminated. They had engaged in war without ceasing; their craving for whatever \nthey could get was insatiable. And this (ruler of Wei) is, like them, one who craves after \nfame and greater substance;—have you not heard it? Those sages were not able to \novercome the thirst for fame and substance;—how much less will you be able to do \nso! Nevertheless you must have some ground (for the course which you wish to take); pray \ntry and tell it to me.' \n\nYen Hui said, 'May I go, doing so in uprightness and humility, using also every endeavour \nto be uniform (in my plans of operation)?' 'No, indeed!' was the reply. 'How can you do \nso? This man makes a display \nof being filled to overflowing (with virtue), and has great self-conceit. His feelings \nare not to be determined from his countenance. Ordinary men do not (venture to) oppose \nhim, and he proceeds from the way in which he affects them  to \nseek still more the satisfaction of his own mind. He may be described as unaffected by \nthe (small lessons of) virtue brought to bear on him from day to day; and how much less \nwill he be so by your great lessons? He will be obstinate, and refuse to be converted. \nHe may outwardly agree with you, but inwardly there will be no self-condemnation;—how \ncan you (go to him in this way and be successful)?' \n\n(Yen Hui) rejoined, 'Well then; while inwardly maintaining my straightforward intention, \nI will outwardly seem to bend to him. I will deliver (my lessons), and substantiate them \nby appealing to antiquity. Inwardly maintaining my straightforward intention, I shall \nbe a co-worker with Heaven. When I thus speak of being a co-worker with Heaven, it is \nbecause I know that (the sovereign, whom we style) the son of Heaven, and myself, are \nequally regarded by Heaven as Its sons. And should I then, as if my words were only my \nown, be seeking to find whether men approved of them, or disapproved of them? In this \nway men will pronounce me a (sincere and simple) \nboy. This is what is called being a co-worker with Heaven. \n\n'Outwardly bending (to the ruler), I shall be a co-worker with other men. To carry (the \nmemorandum tablet to court), \nto kneel, and to bend the body reverentially:—these are the observances of ministers. \nThey all employ them, and should I presume not to do so? Doing what other men do, they \nwould have no occasion to blame me. This  is what is called being \na fellow-worker with other men. \n\n'Fully declaring my sentiments and substantiating them by appealing to antiquity, I shall \nbe a co-worker with the ancients. Although the words in which I convey my lessons may \nreally be condemnatory (of the ruler), they will be those of antiquity, and not my own. \nIn this way, though straightforward, I shall be free from blame. This is what is called \nbeing a co-worker with antiquity. May I go to Wei in this way, and be successful?' 'No \nindeed!' said Kung-ni. 'How can you do so? You have too many plans of proceeding, and \nhave not spied out (the ruler's character). Though you firmly adhere to your plans, you \nmay be held free from transgression, but this will be all the result. How can you (in \nthis way) produce the transformation (which you desire)? All this only shows (in you) \nthe mind of a teacher!' \n\n2. Yen Hui said, 'I can go no farther; I venture to ask the method from you.' Kung-ni \nreplied, 'It is fasting, \n(as) I will tell you. (But) when you have the method, will you find it easy to practise \nit? He who thinks it easy will be disapproved of by the bright Heaven.' Hui said, 'My \nfamily is poor. For months together we have no spirituous drink, nor do we taste the proscribed \nfood or any strong-smelling vegetables;—can \nthis be regarded as fasting?' The reply was, 'It is the fasting appropriate to sacrificing, \nbut it is not the fasting  of the mind.' 'I venture to ask what \nthat fasting of the mind is,' said Hui, and Kung-ni answered, 'Maintain a perfect unity \nin every movement of your will. You will not wait for the hearing of your ears about it, \nbut for the hearing of your mind. You will not wait even for the hearing of your mind, \nbut for the hearing of the spirit. \nLet the hearing (of the ears) rest with the ears. Let the mind rest in the verification \n(of the rightness of what is in the will). But the spirit is free from all pre-occupation \nand so waits for (the appearance of) things. Where the (proper) course is, \nthere is freedom from all pre-occupation;—such freedom is the fasting of the mind.' \nHui said, 'Before it \nwas possible for me to employ (this method), there I was, the Hui that I am; now, that \nI can employ it, the Hui that I was has passed away. Can I be said to have obtained this \nfreedom from pre-occupation?' The Master replied, 'Entirely. I tell you that you can enter \nand be at ease in the enclosure (where he is), and not come into collision with the reputation \n(which belongs to him). If he listen to your counsels, let him hear your notes; if he \nwill not listen, be silent. Open no (other) door; employ no other medicine; dwell with \nhim (as with a friend) in the same apartment, and as if you had no other option, and you \nwill not be far from success in your object. Not to move a step is easy;—to walk \nwithout treading on the ground is difficult. In acting after the manner of men, it is \neasy to fall  into hypocrisy; in acting after the manner of Heaven, \nit is difficult to play the hypocrite. I have heard of flying with wings; I have not heard \nof flying without them. I have heard of the knowledge of the wise; I have not heard of \nthe knowledge of the unwise. Look at that aperture (left in the wall);—the empty \napartment is filled with light through it. Felicitous influences rest (in the mind thus \nemblemed), as in their proper resting place. Even when they do not so rest, we have what \nis called (the body) seated and (the mind) galloping abroad. The information that comes \nthrough the ears and eyes is comprehended internally, and the knowledge of the mind becomes \nsomething external:—(when this is the case), the spiritual intelligences will come, \nand take up their dwelling with us, and how much more will other men do so! All things \nthus undergo a transforming influence. This was the hinge on which Yu and Shun moved; \nit was this which Fu-hsi \nand Ki-khu practised \nall their lives: how much more should other men follow the same rule!' \n\n3. Dze-kao, duke of Sheh, \nbeing about to proceed on a mission to Khi, asked Kung-ni, saying, 'The king is sending \nme, Ku-liang, on a mission which  \nis very important. Khi will probably treat me as his commissioner with great respect, \nbut it will not be in a hurry (to attend to the business). Even an ordinary man cannot \nbe readily moved (to action), and how much less the prince of a state! I am very full \nof apprehension. You, Sir, once said to me that of all things, great or small, there were \nfew which, if not conducted in the proper way, \ncould be brought to a happy conclusion; that, if the thing were not successful, there \nwas sure to be the evil of being dealt with after the manner of men; \nthat, if it were successful, there was sure to be the evil of constant anxiety; \nand that, whether it succeeded or not, it was only the virtuous man who could secure its \nnot being followed by evil. In my diet I take what is coarse, and do not seek delicacies,—a \nman whose cookery does not require him to be using cooling, drinks. This morning I received \nmy charge, and in the evening I am drinking iced water;—am I not feeling the internal \nheat (and discomfort)? Such is my state before I have actually engaged in the affair;—I \nam already suffering from conflicting anxieties. And if the thing do not succeed, (the \nking) is sure to deal with me after the manner of men. The evil is twofold; as a minister, \nI am not able to bear the burden (of the mission). Can  you, \nSir, tell me something (to help me in the case)?' \n\nKung-ni replied, 'In all things under heaven there are two great cautionary considerations:—the \none is the requirement implanted (in the nature); \nthe other is the conviction of what is right. The love of a son for his parents is the \nimplanted requirement, and can never be separated from his heart; the service of his ruler \nby a minister is what is right, and from its obligation there is no escaping anywhere \nbetween heaven and earth. These are what are called the great cautionary considerations. \nTherefore a son finds his rest in serving his parents without reference to or choice of \nplace; and this is the height of filial duty. In the same way a subject finds his rest \nin serving his ruler, without reference to or choice of the business; and this is the \nfullest discharge of loyalty. When men are simply obeying (the dictates of) their hearts, \nthe considerations of grief and joy are not readily set before them. They know that there \nis no alternative to their acting as they do, and rest in it as what is appointed; and \nthis is the highest achievement of virtue. He who is in the position of a minister or \nof a son has indeed to do what he cannot but do. Occupied with the details of the business \n(in hand), and forgetful of his own person, what leisure has he to think of his pleasure \nin living or his dislike of death? You, my master, may well proceed on your mission. \n\n'But let me repeat to you what I have heard:—In  all intercourse \n(between states), if they are near to each other, there should be mutual friendliness, \nverified by deeds; if they are far apart, there must be sincere adherence to truth in \ntheir messages. Those messages will be transmitted by internuncios. But to convey messages \nwhich express the complacence or the dissatisfaction of the two parties is the most difficult \nthing in the world. If they be those of mutual complacence, there is sure to be an overflow \nof expressions of satisfaction; if of mutual dissatisfaction, an overflow of expressions \nof dislike. But all extravagance leads to reckless language, and such language fails to \ncommand belief. When this distrust arises, woe to the internuncio! Hence the Rules for \nSpeech say, \"Transmit \nthe message exactly as it stands; do not transmit it with any overflow of language; so \nis (the internuncio) likely to keep himself whole.\" \n\n4. 'Moreover, skilful wrestlers begin with open trials of strength, but always end with \nmasked attempts (to gain the victory); as their excitement grows excessive, they display \nmuch wonderful dexterity. Parties drinking according to the rules at first observe good \norder, but always end with disorder; as their excitement grows excessive, their fun becomes \nuproarious. In all things \nit is so. People are at first sincere, but always end with becoming rude; at the commencement \nthings are treated as trivial,  but as the end draws near, they \nassume great proportions. Words are (like) the waves acted on by the wind; the real point \nof the matters (discussed by them) is lost. The wind and waves are easily set in motion; \nthe success of the matter of which the real point is lost is easily put in peril. Hence \nquarrels are occasioned by nothing so much as by artful words and one-sided speeches. \nThe breath comes angrily, as when a beast, driven to death, wildly bellows forth its rage. \nOn this animosities arise on both sides. Hasty examination (of the case) eagerly proceeds, \nand revengeful thoughts arise in their minds;—they do not know how. Since they do \nnot know how such thoughts arise, who knows how they will end? Hence the Rules for Speech \nsay, \"Let not an internuncius depart from his instructions. Let him not urge on a settlement. \nIf he go beyond the regular rules, he will complicate matters. Departing from his instructions \nand urging on a settlement imperils negotiations. A good settlement is proved by its lasting \nlong, and a bad settlement cannot be altered;—ought he not to be careful?\" \n\n'Further still, let your mind find its enjoyment in the circumstances of your position; \nnourish the central course which you pursue, by a reference to your unavoidable obligations. \nThis is the highest object for you to pursue; what else can you do to fulfil the charge \n(of your father and ruler). \nThe best thing you can do is to be prepared to sacrifice your life; and this is the most \ndifficult thing to do.' \n\n5. Yen Ho, being about \nto undertake the office of Teacher of the eldest son of duke Ling of Wei, consulted Ku \nPo-yu. 'Here,' said he, \n'is this (young) man, whose natural disposition is as bad as it could be. If I allow him \nto proceed in a bad way, it will be at the peril of our state; if I insist on his proceeding \nin a right way, it will be at the peril of my own person. His wisdom is just sufficient \nto know the errors of other men, but he does not know how he errs himself What am I to \ndo in such a case?' Ku Po-yu replied, 'Good indeed is your question! Be on your guard; \nbe careful; see that you keep yourself correct! Your best plan will be, with your person \nto seek association with him, and with your mind to try to be in harmony with him; and \nyet there are dangers connected with both of these things. While seeking to keep near \nto him, do not enter into his pursuits; while cultivating a harmony of mind with him, \ndo not show how superior you are to him. If in your personal association you enter into \nhis pursuits, you will fall with him and be ruined, you will tumbledown with a crash. \nIf in maintaining a harmony with his mind, you show how different you are from him, he \nwill think you do so for the reputation and the name, and regard you as a creature of \nevil omen. If you find \nhim to be a mere boy, be you with him as another boy; if you find him one of those who \nwill not have their ground marked out in the ordinary way, do you humour  \nhim in this characteristic; \nif you find him to be free from lofty airs, show yourself to be the same;(ever) leading \nhim on so as to keep him free from faults. \n\n'Do you not know (the fate of) the praying mantis? It angrily stretches out its arms, \nto arrest the progress of the carriage, unconscious of its inability for such a task, \nbut showing how much it thinks of its own powers. Be on your guard; be careful. If you \ncherish a boastful confidence in your own excellence, and place yourself in collision \nwith him, you are likely to incur the fate (of the mantis). \n\n'Do you not know how those who keep tigers proceed? They do not dare to supply them with \nliving creatures, because of the rage which their killing of them will excite. They do \nnot (even) dare to give them their food whole, because of the rage which their rending \nof it will excite. They watch till their hunger is appeased, (dealing with them) from \ntheir knowledge of their natural ferocity. Tigers are different from men, but they fawn \non those who feed them, and do so in accordance with their nature. When any of these are \nkilled by them, it is because they have gone against that nature. \n\n'Those again who are fond of horses preserve their dung in baskets, and their urine in \njars. If musquitoes and gadflies light on them, and the grooms brush them suddenly away, \nthe horses break their bits, injure (the ornaments on) their heads, and smash those on \ntheir breasts. The more care that is taken of them, the more does their fondness  \n(for their attendants) disappear. Ought not caution to be exercised (in the management \nof them)?' \n\n6. A (master) mechanic, called Shih, on his way to Khi, came to Khu-yuan, \nwhere he saw an oak-tree, which was used as the altar for the spirits of the land. It \nwas so large that an ox standing behind it could not be seen. It measured a hundred spans \nround, and rose up eighty cubits on the hill before it threw out any branches, after which \nthere were ten or so, from each of which a boat could be hollowed out. People came to \nsee it in crowds as in a market place, but the mechanic did not look round at it, but \nheld on his way without stopping. One of his workmen, however, looked long and admiringly \nat it, and then ran on to his master, and said to him, 'Since I followed you with my axe \nand bill, I have never seen such a beautiful mass of timber as this. Why would you, Sir, \nnot look round at it, but went on without stopping?' 'Have done,' said Mr. Shih, 'and \ndo not speak about it. It is quite useless. A boat made from its wood would sink; a coffin \nor shell would quickly rot; an article of furniture would soon go to pieces; a door would \nbe covered with the exuding sap; a pillar would be riddled by insects; the material of \nit is good for nothing, and hence it is that it has attained to so great an age.' \n\nWhen Mr. Shih was returning, the altar-oak appeared to him in a dream, and said, I What \nother tree will you compare with me? Will you compare me to one of your ornamental trees? \nThere are hawthorns, pear-trees, orange-trees, pummelo-trees, gourds and other low fruit-bearing \nplants. When their fruits are ripe, they are knocked down from them, and thrown among \nthe dirt. The large branches \nare broken, and the smaller are torn away. So it is that their productive ability makes \ntheir lives bitter to them; they do not complete their natural term of existence, but \ncome to a premature end in the middle of their time, bringing on themselves the destructive \ntreatment which they ordinarily receive. It is so with all things. I have sought to discover \nhow it was that I was so useless;—I had long done so, till (the effort) nearly caused \nmy death; and now I have learned it:—it has been of the greatest use to me. Suppose \nthat I had possessed useful properties, should I have become of the great size that I \nam? And moreover you and I are both things;—how should one thing thus pass its judgment \non another? how is it that you a useless man know all this about me a useless tree?' When \nMr. Shih awoke, he kept thinking about his dream, but the workman said, 'Being so taken \nwith its uselessness, how is it that it yet acts here as the altar for the spirits of \nthe land?' 'Be still,' was the master's reply, 'and do not say a word. It simply happened \nto grow here; and thus those who do not know it do not speak ill of it as an evil thing. \nIf it were not used as the altar, would it be in danger of  being \ncut down? Moreover, the reason of its being preserved is different from that of the preservation \nof things generally; is not your explaining it from the sentiment which you have expressed \nwide of the mark?' \n\n7. Nan-po Dze-khi in \nrambling about the Heights of Shang, \nsaw a large and extraordinary tree. The teams of a thousand chariots might be sheltered \nunder it, and its shade would cover them all! Dze-khi said, 'What a tree is this! It must \ncontain an extraordinary amount of timber! When he looked up, however, at its smaller \nbranches, they were so twisted and crooked that they could not be made into rafters and \nbeams; when he looked down to its root, its stem was divided into so many rounded portions \nthat neither coffin nor shell could be made from them. He licked one of its leaves, and \nhis mouth felt torn and wounded. The smell of it would make a man frantic, as if intoxicated, \nfor more than three whole days together. 'This, indeed,' said he, 'is a tree good for \nnothing, and it is thus that it has attained to such a size. Ah! and spirit-like men acknowledge \nthis worthlessness (and its result).' \n\nIn Sung there is the district of King-shih, \nin which catalpae, cypresses, and mulberry trees grow well. Those of them which are a \nspan or two or rather more in circumference \nare cut down by persons who want to make posts to which to tie their  \nmonkeys; those which are three or four spans round are cut down by persons who want beams \nfor their lofty and famous houses; and those of seven or eight spans are cut down by noblemen \nand rich merchants who want single planks for the sides of their coffins. The trees in \nconsequence do not complete their natural term of life, and come to a premature end in \nthe middle of their growth under the axe and bill;—this is the evil that befalls \nthem from their supplying good timber. \n\nIn the same way the Kieh \n(book) specifies oxen that have white foreheads, pigs that have turned-up snouts, and \nmen that are suffering from piles, and forbids their being sacrificed to the Ho. The wizards \nknow them by these peculiarities and consider them to be inauspicious, but spirit-like \nmen consider them on this account to be very fortunate. \n\n8. There was the deformed object Shu. \nHis chin seemed to hide his navel; his shoulders were higher than the crown of his head; \nthe knot of his hair pointed to the sky; his five viscera were all compressed into the \nupper part of his body, and his two thigh bones were like ribs. By sharpening needles \nand washing clothes he was able to make a living. By sifting rice and cleaning it, he \nwas able to support ten individuals. When the government was calling out soldiers, this \npoor Shu would bare his arms among the others; when it had any great service to be undertaken, \nbecause of his constant ailments, none of the work was assigned to him; when it was  \ngiving out grain to the sick, he received three kung, and ten bundles of firewood. If \nthis poor man, so deformed in body, was still able to support himself, and complete his \nterm of life, how much more may they do so, whose deformity is that of their faculties! \n\n9. When Confucius went to Khu, \nKhieh-yu, the madman of Khu, \nas he was wandering about, passed by his door, and said, 'O Phoenix, O Phoenix, how is \nyour virtue degenerated! The future is not to be waited for; the past is not to be sought \nagain! When good order prevails in the world, the sage tries to accomplish all his service; \nwhen disorder prevails, he may preserve his life; at the present time, it is enough if \nhe simply escape being punished. Happiness is lighter than a feather, but no one knows \nhow to support it; calamity is heavier than the earth, and yet no one knows how to avoid \nit. Give over! give over approaching men with the lessons of your virtue! You are in peril! \nyou are in peril, hurrying on where you have marked out the ground against your advance! \nI avoid publicity, I avoid publicity, that my path may not be injured. I pursue my course, \nnow going backwards, now crookedly, that my feet may not be hurt. \n\n'The mountain by its trees weakens itself. \nThe grease which ministers to the fire fries itself The cinnamon tree can be eaten, and \ntherefore it is cut down. The varnish tree is useful, and therefore incisions are made \nin it. All men know the advantage of being useful, but no one knows the advantage of being \nuseless.' \n\n"

    "BOOK V. TEH KHUNG FÛ.": "\n1. In Lu there was a \nWang Thai who had lost \nboth his feet; while \nhis disciples who followed and went about with him were as numerous as those of Kung-ni. \nKhang Ki asked Kung-ni \nabout him, saying, 'Though Wang Thai is a cripple, the disciples who follow him about \ndivide Lu equally with you, Master. When he stands, he does not teach them; when he sits, \nhe does not discourse to them. But they go to him empty, and come back full. Is there \nindeed such a thing as instruction without words? and while the body is imperfect, may the mind be complete? What sort of man \nis he?' \n\nKung-ni replied, 'This master is a sage. I have  only been too \nlate in going to him. I will make him my teacher; and how much more should those do so \nwho are not equal to me! Why should only the state of Lu follow him? I will lead on all \nunder heaven with me to do so.' Khang Ki rejoined, 'He is a man who has lost his feet, \nand yet he is known as the venerable Wang;—he must be very different from ordinary men. What is the peculiar way \nin which he employs his mind?' The reply was, 'Death and life are great considerations, \nbut they could work no change in him. Though heaven and earth were to be overturned and \nfall, they would occasion him no loss. His judgment is fixed regarding that in which there \nis no element of falsehood; \nand, while other things change, he changes not. The transformations of things are to him \nthe developments prescribed for them, and he keeps fast hold of the author of them.' \n\nKhang Ki said, 'What do you mean? When we look at things,' said Kung-ni, 'as they differ, \nwe see them to be different, (as for instance) the liver and the gall, or Khu and Yueh; \nwhen we look at them, as they agree, we see them all to be a unity. So it is with this \n(Wang Thai). He takes no knowledge of the things for which his ears and eyes are the appropriate \norgans, but his mind delights itself in the harmony of (all excellent) qualities. He looks \nat the unity which belongs to things, and does not perceive where they have suffered loss. \nHe looks  on the loss of his feet as only the loss of so much \nearth.'\n\nKhang Ki said, 'He is entirely occupied with his (proper) self. By his knowledge he has discovered (the nature of) his mind, and to that he \nholds as what is unchangeable; but how is \nit that men make so much of him?' The reply was, 'Men do not look into running water as \na mirror, but into still water;—it is only the still water that can arrest them \nall, and keep them (in the contemplation of their real selves). Of things which are what \nthey are by the influence of the earth, it is only the pine and cypress which are the \nbest instances;—in winter as in summer brightly green. \nOf those which were what they were by the influence of Heaven, \nthe most correct examples were Yao and Shun; fortunate in (thus) maintaining their own \nlife correct, and so as to correct the lives of others. \n\n'As a verification of the (power of) the original endowment, when it has been preserved, \ntake the result of fearlessness,—how the heroic spirit of a single brave soldier \nhas been thrown into an army of nine hosts. \nIf a man only seeking for fame and able in this way to secure it can produce such an effect, \nhow much more (may we look for a greater  result) from one whose \nrule is over heaven and earth, and holds all things in his treasury, who simply has his \nlodging in the six members \nof his body, whom his ears and eyes serve but as conveying emblematic images of things, \nwho comprehends all his knowledge in a unity, and whose mind never dies! If such a man \nwere to choose a day on which he would ascend far on high, men would (seek to) follow \nhim there. But how should he be willing to occupy himself with other men?' \n\n2. Shan-thu Kia was (another) \nman who had lost his feet. Along with dze-khan \nof Kang he studied under the master Po-hwan \nWu-zan. Dze-khan said \nto him (one day), 'If I go out first, do you remain behind; and if you go out first, I \nwill remain behind.' Next day they were again sitting together on the same mat in the \nhall, when Dze-khan spoke the same words to him, adding,' Now I am about to go out; will \nyou stay behind or not? Moreover, when you see one of official rank (like myself), you \ndo not try to get out of his way;—do you consider yourself equal to one of official \nrank?' Shan-thu Kia replied, 'In our Master's school is there indeed such recognition \nrequired of official rank? You are one, Sir, whose pleasure is in your official rank, \nand would therefore take precedence of other men. I  have heard \nthat when a mirror is bright, the dust does not rest on it; when dust rests on it the \nmirror is not bright. When one dwells long with a man of ability and virtue, he comes \nto be without error. There now is our teacher whom you have chosen to make you greater \nthan you are; and when you still talk in this way, are you not in error?' Dze-khan rejoined, \n'A (shattered) object as you are, you would still strive to make yourself out as good \nas Yao! If I may form an estimate of your virtue, might it not be sufficient to lead you \nto the examination of yourself?' The other said, 'Most criminals, in describing their \noffences, would make it out that they ought not to have lost (their feet) for them; few \nwould describe them so as to make it appear that they should not have preserved their \nfeet. They are only the virtuous who know that such a calamity was unavoidable, and therefore \nrest in it as what was appointed for them. When men stand before (an archer like) I \nwith his bent bow, if they are in the middle of his field, that is the place where they \nshould be hit; and if they be not hit, that also was appointed. There are many with their \nfeet entire who laugh at me because I have lost my feet, which makes me feel vexed and \nangry. But when I go to our teacher, I throw off that feeling, and return (to a better \nmood);—he has washed, without my knowing it, the other from me by (his instructions \nin) what is good. I have attended him now for nineteen years, and have not known that \nI am without my feet. Now, you, Sir, and I have for the object of our study the  \n(virtue) which is internal, and not an adjunct of the body, and yet you are continually \ndirecting your attention to my external body;—are you not wrong in this?' Dze-khan \nfelt uneasy, altered his manner and looks, and said, 'You need not, Sir, say anything \nmore about it.' \n\n3. In Lu there was a cripple, called Shu-shan the Toeless, \nwho came on his heels to see Kung-ni. Kung-ni said to him, 'By your want of circumspection \nin the past, Sir, you have incurred such a calamity;—of what use is your coming \nto me now?' Toeless said, 'Through my ignorance of my proper business and taking too little \ncare of my body, I came to lose my feet. But now I am come to you, still possessing what \nis more honourable than my feet, and which therefore I am anxious to preserve entire. \nThere is nothing which Heaven does not cover, and nothing which Earth does not sustain; \nyou, Master, were regarded by me as doing the part of Heaven and Earth;—how could \nI know that you would receive me in such a way?' Confucius rejoined, 'I am but a poor \ncreature. But why, my master, do you not come inside, where I will try to tell you what \nI have learned?' When Toeless had gone out, Confucius said, 'Be stimulated to effort, \nmy disciples. This toeless cripple is still anxious to learn to make up for the evil of \nhis former conduct;—how much more should those be so whose conduct has been unchallenged!' \n\nMr. Toeless, however, told Lao Tan (of the interview),  saying, \n'Khung Khiu, I apprehend, has not yet attained to be a Perfect man. What has he to do \nwith keeping a crowd of disciples around him? He is seeking to the reputation of being \nan extraordinary and marvellous man, and does not know that the Perfect man considers \nthis to be as handcuffs and fetters to him.' Lao Tan said, 'Why did you not simply lead \nhim to see the unity of life and death, and that the admissible and inadmissible belong \nto one category, so freeing him from his fetters? Would this be possible?' Toeless said, \n'It is the punishment inflicted on him by Heaven. \nHow can he be freed from it?' \n\n4. Duke Ai of Lu asked \nKung-ni, saying, 'There was an ugly man in Wei, called Ai-thai Tho. \nHis father-in-law, who lived with him, thought so much of him that he could not be away \nfrom him. His wife, when she saw him (ugly as he was), represented to her parents, saying, \n\"I had more than ten times rather be his concubine than the wife of any other man.\" \nHe was never heard to take the lead in discussion, but always seemed to be of the same \nopinion with others. He had not the position of a ruler, so as to be able to save men \nfrom death. He had no revenues, so as to be able to satisfy men's craving for food. He \nwas ugly enough, moreover, to scare  the whole world. He agreed \nwith men instead of trying to lead them to adopt his views; his knowledge did not go beyond \nhis immediate neighbourhood. \nAnd yet his father-in-law and his wife were of one mind about him in his presence (as \nI have said);—he must have been different from other men. I called him, and saw \nhim. Certainly he was ugly enough to scare the whole world. He had not lived with me, \nhowever. for many months, when I was drawn to the man; and before he had been with me \na full year, I had confidence in him. The state being without a chief minister, I (was \nminded) to commit the government to him. He responded to my proposal sorrowfully, and \nlooked undecided as if he would fain have declined it. I was ashamed of myself (as inferior \nto him), but finally gave the government into his hands. In a little time, however, he \nleft me and went away. I was sorry and felt that I had sustained a loss, and as if there \nwere no other to share the pleasures of the kingdom with me. What sort of man was he?' \n\nKung-ni said, 'Once when I was sent on a mission to Khu, I saw some pigs sucking at their \ndead mother. After a little they looked with rapid glances, when they all left her, and \nran away. They felt that she did not see them, and that she was no longer like themselves. \nWhat they had loved in their mother was not her bodily figure, but what had given animation \nto her figure. When a man dies in battle, they do not at his interment employ the usual \nappendages : \nas to supplying shoes to one who has lost his feet, there is no reason why he should care \nfor them;—in neither case is there the the proper reason for their use'. The members \nof the royal harem do not pare their nails nor pierce their ears; \nwhen a man is newly married, he remains (for a time) absent from his official duties, \nand unoccupied with them. That their bodies \nmight be perfect was sufficient to make them thus dealt with;—how much greater results \nshould be expected from men whose mental gifts are perfect! This Ai-thai Tho was believed \nby men, though he did not speak a word, and was loved by them, though he did no special \nservice for them. He made men appoint him to the government of their states, afraid only \nthat he would not accept the appointment. He must have been a man whose powers \nwere perfect, though his realisation of them \nwas not manifested in his person.' \n\nDuke Ai said, 'What is meant by saying that his powers were complete?' Kung-ni replied, \n'Death and life, preservation and ruin, failure and success, poverty and wealth, superiority \nand inferiority, blame and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat;—these are the \nchanges of circumstances, the operation of our appointed lot. Day and night they succeed \nto one another before us, but there is no wisdom  able to discover \nto what they owe their origination. They are not sufficient therefore to disturb the harmony \n(of the nature), and are not allowed to enter into the treasury of intelligence. To cause \nthis harmony and satisfaction ever to be diffused, while the feeling of pleasure is not \nlost from the mind; to allow no break to arise in this state day or night, so that it \nis always spring-time \nin his relations with external things; in all his experiences to realise in his mind what \nis appropriate to each season (of the year):—these \nare the characteristics of him whose powers are perfect.' \n\n'And what do you mean by the realisation of these powers not being manifested in the person?' \n(pursued further the duke). The reply was, 'There is nothing so level as the surface of \na pool of still water. It may serve as an example of what I mean. All within its circuit \nis preserved (in peace), and there comes to it no agitation from without. The virtuous \nefficacy is the perfect cultivation of the harmony (of the nature). Though the realisation \nof this be not manifested in the person, things cannot separate themselves (from its influence).' \n\nSome days afterwards duke Ai told this conversation to Min Tzu, \nsaying, 'Formerly it seemed to me the work of the sovereign to stand in court with his \nface to the south, to rule the kingdom, and to pay good heed to the accounts of the people \nconcerned, lest any should come to a (miserable) death;—this  \nI considered to be the sum (of his duty). Now that I have heard that description of the \nPerfect man, I fear that my idea is not the real one, and that, by employing myself too \nlightly, I may cause the ruin of my state. I and Khung Khiu are not on the footing of \nruler and subject, but on that of a virtuous friendship.' \n\n5. A person who had no lips, whose legs were bent so that he could only walk on his toes, \nand who was (otherwise) deformed, \naddressed his counsels to duke Ling of Wei, who was so pleased with him, that he looked \non a perfectly formed man as having a lean and small neck in comparison with him. Another \nwho had a large goitre like an earthenware jar \naddressed his counsels to duke Hwan of Khi, \nwho was so pleased with him that he looked on a perfectly formed man as having a neck \nlean and small in comparison with him. \nSo it is that when one's virtue is extraordinary, (any deficiency in) his bodily form \nmay be forgotten. When men do not forget what is (easily) forgotten, and forget what is \nnot (easily) forgotten, we have a case of real oblivion. Therefore the sagely man has \nthat in which his mind finds its enjoyment, and (looks on) wisdom as (but) the shoots \nfrom an old stump; agreements with others are to him but so much glue; kindnesses are \n (but the arts of) intercourse; and great skill is (but as) merchants' \nwares. The sagely man lays no plans;—of what use would wisdom be to him? He has \nno cutting and hacking to do;—of what use would glue be to him? He has lost nothing; \nof what use would arts of intercourse be to him? He has no goods to dispose of;—what \nneed has he to play the merchant? (The want of) these four things are the nourishment \nof (his) Heavenly (nature); that nourishment is its Heavenly food. Since he receives this \nfood from Heaven, what need has he for anything of man's (devising)? He has the bodily \nform of man, but not the passions and desires of (other) men. He has the form of man, \nand therefore he is a man. Being without the passions and desires of men, their approvings \nand disapprovings are not to be found in him. How insignificant and small is (the body) \nby which he belongs to humanity! How grand and great is he in the unique perfection of \nhis Heavenly (nature)! \n\nHui Tzu said to Chuang Tzu, 'Can a man indeed be without desires and passions?' The reply \nwas, 'He can.' 'But on what grounds do you call him a man, who is thus without passions \nand desires?' Chuang Tzu said, 'The Tao \ngives him his personal appearance (and powers); Heaven \ngives him his bodily form; how should we not call him a man?' Hui Tzu rejoined, 'Since \nyou call him a man, how  can he be without passions and desires?' \nThe reply was, 'You are misunderstanding what I mean by passions and desires. What I mean \nwhen I say that he is without these is, that this man does not by his likings and dislikings \ndo any inward harm to his body;—he always pursues his course without effort, and \ndoes not (try to) increase his (store of) life.' Hui Tzu rejoined, 'If there were not \nthat increasing of (the amount) of life, how would he get his body?' \nChuang Tzu said, 'The Tao gives him his personal appearance (and powers); Heaven gives \nhim his bodily form; and he does not by his likings and dislikings do any internal harm \nto his body. But now you, Sir, deal with your spirit as if it were something external \nto you, and subject your vital powers to toil. You sing (your ditties), leaning against \na tree; you go to sleep, grasping the stump of a rotten dryandra tree. Heaven selected \nfor you the bodily form (of a man), and you babble about what is strong and what is white.' \n"

    "BOOK VI. TÂ ZUNG SHIH.": "\n1. He who knows the part which the Heavenly (in him) plays, and knows (also) that which \nthe Human (in him ought to) play, has reached \nthe perfection (of knowledge). He who knows the part which the Heavenly plays (knows) \nthat it is naturally born with him; he who knows the part which the Human ought to play \n(proceeds) with the knowledge which he possesses to nourish it in the direction of what \nhe does not (yet) know:—to \ncomplete one's natural term of years and not come to an untimely end in the middle of \nhis course is the fulness of knowledge. Although it be so, there is an evil (attending \nthis condition). Such knowledge still awaits the confirmation of it as correct; it does \nso because it is not yet determined. How do we know that what  we call the Heavenly (in \nus) is not the Human? and that what we call the Human is not the Heavenly? There must \nbe the True man, and \nthen there is the True knowledge. \n\n2. What is meant by 'the True Man?' The True men of old did not reject (the views of) the few; they did not seek \nto accomplish (their ends) like heroes (before others); they did not lay plans to attain \nthose ends. Being such, \nthough they might make mistakes, they had no occasion for repentance; though they might \nsucceed, they had no self-complacency. Being such, they could ascend the loftiest heights \nwithout fear; they could pass through water without being made wet by it; they could go \ninto fire without being burnt; so it was  that by their knowledge \nthey ascended to and reached the Tao. \n\nThe True men of old did not dream when they slept, had no anxiety when they awoke, and \ndid not care that their food should be pleasant. Their breathing came deep and silently. \nThe breathing of the true man comes (even) from his heels, while men generally breathe \n(only) from their throats. When men are defeated in argument, their words come from their \ngullets as if they were vomiting. Where lusts and desires are deep, the springs of the \nHeavenly are shallow. \n\nThe True men of old knew nothing of the love of life or of the hatred of death. Entrance \ninto life occasioned them no joy; the exit from it awakened no resistance. Composedly \nthey went and came. They did not forget what their beginning had been, and they did not \ninquire into what their end would be. They accepted (their life) and rejoiced in it; they \nforgot (all fear of death), and returned (to their state before life). Thus there was in them what is called the want of any mind to resist the Tao, \nand of all attempts by means of the Human to assist the Heavenly. Such were they who are \ncalled the True men. \n\n3. Being such, their minds were free from all thought; their demeanour was still and unmoved;  their foreheads \nbeamed simplicity. Whatever coldness came from them was like that of autumn; whatever \nwarmth came from them was like that of spring. Their joy and anger assimilated to what \nwe see in the four seasons. They did in regard to all things what was suitable, and no \none could know how far their action would go. Therefore the sagely man might, in his conduct \nof war, destroy a state without losing the hearts of the people; \nhis benefits and favours might extend to a myriad generations without his being a lover \nof men. Hence he who tries to share his joys with others is not a sagely man; he who manifests \naffection is not benevolent; he who observes times and seasons (to regulate his conduct) \nis not a man of wisdom; he to whom profit and injury are not the same is not a superior \nman; he who acts for the sake of the name of doing so, and loses his (proper) self is \nnot the (right) scholar; and he who throws away his person in a way which is not the true \n(way) cannot command the service of others. Such men as Hu Pu-kieh, Wu Kwang, Po-i, Shu-khi, \nthe count of Ki, Hsu-yu, Ki Tha, and Shan-thu Ti, all did service for other men, and sought \nto secure for them what they desired, not seeking their own pleasure. \n\n4. The True men of old presented the aspect of judging others aright, but without being \npartisans; of feeling their own insufficiency, but being without flattery or cringing. \nTheir peculiarities were natural to them, but they were not obstinately attached to them; \ntheir humility was evident, but there was nothing of unreality or display about it. Their \nplacidity and satisfaction had the appearance of joy; their every movement seemed to be \na necessity to them. Their accumulated attractiveness drew men's looks to them; their \nblandness fixed men's attachment to their virtue. They seemed to accommodate themselves \nto the (manners of their age), but with a certain severity; their haughty indifference \nwas beyond its control. Unceasing seemed their endeavours to keep (their mouths) shut; \nwhen they looked down, they had forgotten what they wished to say. \n\nThey considered punishments to be the substance (of government, and they never incurred \nit); ceremonies to be its supporting wings (and they always observed them); wisdom (to \nindicate) the time (for action, and they always selected it); and virtue to be accordance \n(with others), and they were all-accordant. Considering punishments to be the substance \n(of government), yet their generosity appeared in the (manner of their) infliction of \ndeath. Considering ceremonies to be its supporting wings, they pursued  \nby means of them their course in the world. Considering wisdom to indicate the time (for \naction), they felt it necessary to employ it in (the direction of) affairs. Considering \nvirtue to be accordance (with others), they sought to ascend its height along with all \nwho had feet (to climb it). (Such were they), and yet men really thought that they did \nwhat they did by earnest effort. \n\n5. In this way they were one and the same in all their likings and dislikings. Where they \nliked, they were the same; where they did not like, they were the same. In the former \ncase where they liked, they were fellow-workers with the Heavenly (in them); in the latter \nwhere they disliked, they were coworkers with the Human in them. The one of these elements \n(in their nature) did not overcome the other. Such were those who are called the True \nmen. \n\nDeath and life are ordained, just as we have the constant succession of night and day;—in \nboth cases from Heaven. Men have no power to do anything in reference to them;—such \nis the constitution of things. \nThere are those who specially regard Heaven \nas their father, and they still love It (distant as It is);—how \nmuch more should they love  That which stands out (Superior and \nAlone)! Some specially \nregard their ruler as superior to themselves, and will give their bodies to die for him; \nhow much more should they do so for That which is their true (Ruler)! \nWhen the springs are dried up, the fishes collect together on the land. Than that they \nshould moisten one another there by the damp about them, and keep one another wet by their \nslime, it would be better for them to forget one another in the rivers and lakes. \nAnd when men praise Yao and condemn Kieh, it would be better to forget them both, and \nseek the renovation of the Tao. \n\n6. There is the great Mass (of nature);—I find the support of my body on it; my \nlife is spent in toil on it; my old age seeks ease on it; at death I find rest in it;—what \nmakes my life a good makes my death also a good. \nIf you hide away a boat in the ravine of a hill, and hide away the hill in a lake, you \nwill say that (the boat) is secure; but at midnight there shall come a strong man and \ncarry it off on his back, while you in the dark know nothing about it. You may hide away \nanything, whether small or great, in the most suitable place, and yet it shall disappear \nfrom it. But if you could hide the world in the world, \nso that there was nowhere to which it could be removed, this would be the grand reality \nof the  ever-during Thing. \nWhen the body of man comes from its special mould, \nthere is even then occasion for joy; but this body undergoes a myriad transformations, \nand does not immediately reach its perfection;—does it not thus afford occasion \nfor joys incalculable? Therefore the sagely man enjoys himself in that from which there \nis no possibility of separation, and by which all things are preserved. He considers early \ndeath or old age, his beginning and his ending, all to be good, and in this other men \nimitate him;—how much more will they do so in regard to That Itself on which all \nthings depend, and from which every transformation arises! \n\n7. This is the Tao;—there is in It emotion and sincerity, but It does nothing and \nhas no bodily form. It \nmay be handed down (by the teacher), but may not be received (by his scholars). It may \nbe apprehended (by the mind), but It cannot be seen. It has Its root and ground (of existence) \nin Itself. Before there were heaven and earth, from of old, there It was, securely existing. \nFrom It came the mysterious existences of spirits, from It the mysterious existence of \nGod. It produced heaven; \nIt produced earth. It was before the Thai-ki, \nand  yet could not be considered high; \nIt was below all space, and yet could not be considered deep. \nIt was produced before heaven and earth, and yet could not be considered to have existed \nlong; It was older than the highest antiquity, \nand yet could not be considered old. \n\nShih-wei got It, and \nby It adjusted heaven and earth. Fu-hsi got It, and by It penetrated to the mystery of \nthe maternity of the primary matter. The Wei-tau \ngot It, and from all antiquity has made no eccentric movement. The Sun and Moon got It, \nand from all antiquity have not intermitted (their bright shining). Khan-pei got It, and \nby It became lord of Khwan-lun. \nFang-i got It, and by \nIt enjoyed himself in the Great River. Kien Wu \ngot It, and by It dwelt on mount Thai. Hwang-Ti \ngot It, and by It ascended the cloudy sky. Kwan-hsu \n got It, and by It dwelt in the Dark Palace. Yu-khiang \ngot It, and by It was set on the North Pole. Hsi Wang-mu \ngot It, and by It had her seat in (the palace of) Shao-kwang. No one knows Its beginning; \nno one knows Its end. Phang Zu got It, and lived on from the time of the lord of Yu to \nthat of the Five Chiefs. \nFu Yueh got It, and by \nIt became chief minister to Wu-ting, (who \nthus) in a trice became master of the kingdom. (After his death), Fu Yueh mounted to the \neastern portion of the Milky Way, where, riding on Sagittarius and Scorpio, he took his \nplace among the stars. \n\n8. Nan-po Dze-khwei, \nasked Nu Yu, saying, \n'You are old, Sir, while your complexion is like that of a child;—how is it so?' \nThe reply was, 'I have become acquainted with the Tao.' The other said, 'Can I learn the \nTao?' Nu Yu said, 'No. How can you? You, Sir, are not the man to do so. There was Pu-liang \nI who had the abilities \nof a sagely man, but not the Tao, while I had the Tao, but not the abilities. I wished, \nhowever, to teach him, if, peradventure, he might  become the \nsagely man indeed. If he should not do so, it was easy (I thought) for one possessing \nthe Tao of the sagely man to communicate it to another possessing his abilities. Accordingly, \nI proceeded to do so, but with deliberation. \nAfter three days, he was able to banish from his mind all worldly (matters). This accomplished, \nI continued my intercourse with him in the same way; and in seven days he was able to \nbanish from his mind all thought of men and things. This accomplished, and my instructions \ncontinued, after nine days, he was able to count his life as foreign to himself. This \naccomplished, his mind was afterwards clear as the morning; and after this he was able \nto see his own individuality. \nThat individuality perceived, he was able to banish all thought of Past or Present. Freed \nfrom this, he was able to penetrate to (the truth that there is no difference between) \nlife and death;—(how) the destruction of life is not dying, and the communication \nof other life is not living. (The Tao) is a thing which accompanies all other things and \nmeets them, which is present when they are overthrown and when they obtain their completion. \nIts name is Tranquillity amid all Disturbances, meaning that such Disturbances lead to \nIts Perfection.' \n\n'And how did you, being alone (without any teacher), learn all this?' 'I learned it,' \nwas the reply, 'from the son of Fu-mo; \nhe learned it from  the grandson of Lo-sung; he learned it from \nShan-ming; he learned it from Nieh-hsu; he, from Hsu-yi; he, from Wu-ao; he, from Hsuan-ming; \nhe, from Zhan-liao; and he learned it from I-shih.' \n\n9. Dze-sze, Dze-yu, \nDze-1i, and Dze-lai, \nthese four men, were talking together, when some one said, 'Who can suppose the head to \nbe made from nothing, the spine from life, and the rump-bone from death? Who knows how \ndeath and birth, living on and disappearing, compose the one body?—I would be friends \nwith him.' The four men \nlooked at one another and laughed, but no one seized with his mind the drift of the questions. \nAll, however, were friends together. \n\nNot long after Dze-yu fell ill, and Dze-sze went to inquire for him. 'How great,' said \n(the sufferer), 'is the Creator! \nThat He should have made me the deformed object that I am!' He was a crooked hunchback; \nhis five viscera were squeezed into the  upper part of his body; \nhis chin bent over his navel; his shoulder was higher than his crown; on his crown was \nan ulcer pointing to the sky; his breath came and went in gasps:—yet \nhe was easy in his mind, and made no trouble of his condition. He limped to a well, looked \nat himself in it, and said, 'Alas that the Creator should have made me the deformed object \nthat I am!' Dze said, 'Do you dislike your condition?' He replied, 'No, why should I dislike \nit? If He were to transform my left arm into a cock, I should be watching with it the \ntime of the night; if He were to transform my right arm into a cross-bow, I should then \nbe looking for a hsiao to (bring down and) roast; if He were to transform my rump-bone \ninto a wheel, and my spirit into a horse, I should then be mounting it, and would not \nchange it for another steed. Moreover, when we have got (what we are to do), there is \nthe time (of life) in which to do it; when we lose that (at death), submission (is what \nis required). When we rest in what the time requires, and manifest that submission, neither \njoy nor sorrow can find entrance (to the mind). \nThis would be what the ancients called loosing the cord by which (the life) is suspended. \nBut one hung up cannot loose himself;—he is held fast by his bonds. \nAnd that creatures cannot overcome  Heaven (the inevitable) is \na long-acknowledged fact;—why should I hate my condition?' \n\n10. Before long Dze-lai fell ill, and lay gasping at the point of death, while his wife \nand children stood around him wailing. \nDze-li went to ask for him, and said to them, 'Hush! Get out of the way! Do not disturb \nhim as he is passing through his change.' Then, leaning against the door, he said (to \nthe dying man), 'Great indeed is the Creator! What will He now make you to become? Where \nwill He take you to? Will He make you the liver of a rat, or the arm of an insect? \nDze-lai replied, 'Wherever a parent tells a son to go, east, west, south, or north, he \nsimply follows the command. The Yin and Yang are more to a man than his parents are. If \nthey are hastening my death, and I do not quietly submit to them, I shall be obstinate \nand rebellious. There is the great Mass (of nature);—I find the support of my body \nin it; my life is spent in toil on it; my old age seeks ease on it; at death I find rest \non it:—what has made my life a good will make my death also a good. \n\n'Here now is a great founder, casting his metal. If the metal were to leap up (in the \npot), and say, \"I must be made into a (sword like the) Mo-yeh.\" \n the great founder would be sure to regard it as uncanny. So, \nagain, when a form is being fashioned in the mould of the womb, if it were to say, \"I \nmust become a man; I must become a man,\" the Creator would be sure to regard it as uncanny. \nWhen we once understand that heaven and earth are a great melting-pot, and the Creator \na great founder, where can we have to go to that shall not be right for us? We are born \nas from a quiet sleep, and we die to a calm awaking.' \n\n11. Dze-sang Hu, Mang \nDze-fan, and Dze-khin Kang, \nthese three men, were friends together. (One of them said), 'Who can associate together \nwithout any (thought of) such association, or act together without any (evidence of) such \nco-operation? Who can mount up into the sky and enjoy himself amidst the mists, disporting \nbeyond the utmost limits (of things), \nand forgetting all others as if this were living, and would have no end?' The three men \nlooked at one another and laughed, not perceiving the drift of the questions; and they \ncontinued to associate together as friends. \n\nSuddenly, after a time, \nDze-sang Hia died. Before he was buried, Confucius heard of the event, and  \nsent Dze-kung to go and see if he could render any assistance. One of the survivors had \ncomposed a ditty, and the other was playing on his lute. Then they sang together in unison, \n\n'Ah! come, Sang Hu ah! come, Sang Hu!\nYour being true you've got again,\nWhile we, as men, still here remain\nOhone!'\n\nDze-kung hastened forward to them, and said, 'I venture to ask whether it be according \nto the rules to be singing thus in the presence of the corpse?' The two men looked at \neach other, and laughed, saying, 'What does this man know about the idea that underlies \n(our) rules?' Dze-kung returned to Confucius, and reported to him, saying, 'What sort \nof men are those? They had made none of the usual preparations, \nand treated the body as a thing foreign to them. They were singing in the presence of \nthe corpse, and there was no change in their countenances. I cannot describe them;—what \nsort of men are they?' Confucius replied, 'Those men occupy and enjoy themselves in what \nis outside the (common) ways (of the world), while I occupy and enjoy myself in what lies \nwithin those ways. There is no common ground for those of such different ways; and when \n1 sent you to condole with those men, I was acting stupidly. They, moreover, make man \nto be the fellow of the  Creator, and seek their enjoyment in \nthe formless condition of heaven and earth. They consider life to be an appendage attached, \nan excrescence annexed to them, and death to be a separation of the appendage and a dispersion \nof the contents of the excrescence. With these views, how should they know wherein death \nand life are to be found, or what is first and what is last? They borrow different substances, \nand pretend that the common form of the body is composed of them. \nThey dismiss the thought of (its inward constituents like) the liver and gall, and (its \noutward constituents), the ears and eyes. Again and again they end and they begin, having \nno knowledge of first principles. They occupy themselves ignorantly and vaguely with what \n(they say) lies outside the dust and dirt (of the world), and seek their enjoyment in \nthe business of doing nothing. How should they confusedly address themselves to the ceremonies \npractised by the common people, and exhibit themselves as doing so to the ears and eyes \nof the multitude?' \n\nDze-kung said, 'Yes, but why do you, Master, act according to the (common) ways (of the \nworld)?' The reply was, 'I am in this under the condemning sentence of Heaven. \nNevertheless, I will share  with you (what I have attained to).' \nDze-kung rejoined, 'I venture to ask the method which you pursue;' and Confucius said, \n'Fishes breed and grow in the water; man developes {sic—jbh} in the Tao. Growing \nin the water, the fishes cleave the pools, and their nourishment is supplied to them. \nDeveloping in the Tao, men do nothing, and the enjoyment of their life is secured. Hence \nit is said, \"Fishes forget one another in the rivers and lakes; men forget one another \nin the arts of the Tao.\"' \n\nDze-kung said, 'I venture to ask about the man who stands aloof from others.' \nThe reply was, 'He stands aloof from other men, but he is in accord with Heaven! Hence \nit is said, \"The small man of Heaven is the superior man among men; the superior man among \nmen is the small man of Heaven!\"' \n\n12. Yen Hui asked Kung-ni, saying, 'When the mother of Mang-sun Zhai \ndied, in all his wailing for her he did not shed a tear; in the core of his heart he felt \nno distress; during all the mourning rites, he exhibited no sorrow. Without these three \nthings, he (was considered to have) discharged his mourning well;—is it that in \nthe state of Lu one who has not the reality may yet get the reputation of having it? I \nthink the matter very strange.' Kung-ni  said, 'That Mang-sun \ncarried out (his views) to the utmost. He was advanced in knowledge; but (in this case) \nit was not possible for him to appear to be negligent (in his ceremonial observances), \nbut he succeeded in being really so to himself Mang-sun does not know either what purposes \nlife serves, or what death serves; he does not know which should be first sought, and \nwhich last. If he is \nto be transformed into something else, he will simply await the transformation which he \ndoes not yet know. This is all he does. And moreover, when one is about to undergo his \nchange, how does he know that it has not taken place? And when he is not about to undergo \nhis change, how does he know that it has taken place? \nTake the case of me and you:—are we in a dream from which we have not begun to awake? \n\n'Moreover, Mang-sun presented in his body the appearance of being agitated, but in his \nmind he was conscious of no loss. The death was to him like the issuing from one's dwelling \nat dawn, and no (more terrible) reality. He was more awake than others were. When they \nwailed, he also wailed, having in himself the reason why he did so. And we all have our \nindividuality which makes us what we are as compared together; but how do we know that \nwe  determine in any case correctly that individuality? Moreover \nyou dream that you are a bird, and seem to be soaring to the sky; or that you are a fish, \nand seem to be diving in the deep. But you do not know whether we that are now speaking \nare awake or in a dream. \nIt is not the meeting with what is pleasurable that produces the smile; it is not the \nsmile suddenly produced that produces the arrangement (of the person). When one rests \nin what has been arranged, and puts away all thought of the transformation, he is in unity \nwith the mysterious Heaven.' \n\n13. I-r Dze having gone \nto see Hsu Yu, the latter said to him, 'What benefit have you received from Yao?' The \nreply was, 'Yao says to me, You must yourself labour at benevolence and righteousness, \nand be able to tell clearly which is right and which wrong (in conflicting statements).' \nHsu Yu rejoined, 'Why then have you come to me? Since Yao has put on you the brand of \nhis benevolence and righteousness, and cut off your nose with his right and wrong, \nhow will you be able to wander in the way of aimless enjoyment, of unregulated contemplation, \nand the ever-changing forms (of dispute)?' I-r dze said, 'That may be; but I should  \nlike to skirt along its hedges.' 'But,' said the other, 'it cannot be. Eyes without pupils \ncan see nothing of the beauty of the eyebrows, eyes, and other features; the blind have \nnothing to do with the green, yellow, and variegated colours of the sacrificial robes.' \nI-r dze rejoined, 'Yet, when Wu-kwang \nlost his beauty, Ku-liang his strength, and \nHwang-Ti his wisdom, they all (recovered them) \nunder the moulding (of your system);—how do you know that the Maker will not obliterate \nthe marks of my branding, and supply my dismemberment, so that, again perfect in my form, \nI may follow you as my teacher?' Hsu Yu said, 'Ah! that cannot yet be known. I will tell \nyou the rudiments. O my Master! O my Master! He gives to all things their blended qualities, \nand does not count it any righteousness; His favours reach to all generations, and He \ndoes not count it any benevolence; He is more ancient than the highest antiquity, and \ndoes not count Himself old; He overspreads heaven and supports the earth; He carves and \nfashions all bodily forms, and does not consider it any act of skill;—this is He \nin whom I find my enjoyment.' \n\n14. Yen Hui said, 'I am making progress.' Kung-ni replied, 'What do you mean?' 'I have \nceased to think of benevolence and righteousness,' was the reply. 'Very well; but that \nis not enough.' \n\nAnother day, Hui again saw Kung-ni, and said, 'I am making progress.' 'What do you mean?' \n 'I have lost all thought of ceremonies and music.' 'Very well, \nbut that is not enough.' \n\nA third day, Hui again saw (the Master), and said, 'I am making progress.' 'What do you \nmean?' 'I sit and forget everything.' \nKung-ni changed countenance, and said, 'What do you mean by saying that you sit and forget \n(everything)?' Yen Hui replied, 'My connexion with the body and its parts is dissolved; \nmy perceptive organs are discarded. Thus leaving my material form, and bidding farewell \nto my knowledge, I am become one with the Great Pervader. \nThis I call sitting and forgetting all things.' Kung-ni said, 'One (with that Pervader), \nyou are free from all likings; so transformed, you are become impermanent. You have, indeed, \nbecome superior to me! I must ask leave to follow in your steps.' \n\n15. Dze-yu and Dze-sang \nwere friends. (Once), when it had rained continuously for ten days, Dze-yu said, 'I fear \nthat Dze-sang may be in distress.' So he wrapped up some rice, and went to give it to \nhim to eat. When he came to Dze-sang's door, there issued from it sounds between singing \nand wailing;  a lute was struck, and there came the words, 'O \nFather! O Mother! O Heaven! O Men!' The voice could not sustain itself, and the line was \nhurriedly pronounced. Dze-yu entered and said, 'Why are you singing, Sir, this line of \npoetry in such a way?' The other replied, 'I was thinking, and thinking in vain, how it \nwas that I was brought to such extremity. Would my parents have wished me to be so poor? \nHeaven overspreads all without any partial feeling, and so does Earth sustain all;—would \nHeaven and Earth make me so poor with any unkindly feeling? I was trying to find out who \nhad done it, and I could not do so. But here I am in this extremity!—it is what \nwas appointed for me!' \n"

    "BOOK VII. YING TÎ WANG.": "\n1. Nieh Khueh put four \nquestions to Wang I, not one of which did \nhe know (how to answer). On this Nieh Khueh leaped up, and in great delight walked away \nand informed Phu-i Tzu \nof it, who said to him, 'Do you (only) now know it? He of the line of Yu was not equal to him of the line of Thai. He of Yu still kept in himself (the idea of) benevolence by which to constrain \n(the submission of) men; and he did win men, but he had not begun to proceed by what did \nnot belong to him as a man. He of the line of Thai would sleep tranquilly, and awake in \ncontented simplicity. He would consider himself now (merely) as a horse, and now (merely) \nas an ox. His knowledge \nwas real and untroubled  by doubts; and his virtue was very true:—he \nhad not begun to proceed by what belonged to him as a man. \n\n2. Kien Wu went to see \nthe mad (recluse), Khieh-yu, \nwho said to him, 'What did Zah-kung Shih tell you?' The reply was, 'He told me that when rulers gave forth their regulations \naccording to their own views and enacted righteous measures, no one would venture not \nto obey them, and all would be transformed.' Khieh-yd said, 'That is but the hypocrisy \nof virtue. For the right ordering of the world it would be like trying to wade through \nthe sea and dig through the Ho, or employing a musquito to carry a mountain on its back. \nAnd when a sage is governing, does he govern men's outward actions? He is (himself) correct, \nand so (his government) goes on;—this is the simple and certain way by which he \nsecures the success of his affairs. Think of the bird which flies high, to avoid being \nhurt by the dart on the string of the archer, and the little mouse which makes its hole \ndeep under Shan-khiu \nto avoid the danger of being smoked or dug out;—are (rulers) less knowing than these \ntwo little creatures?' \n\n3. Thien Kan, rambling \non the south of (mount) Yin, \ncame to the neighbourhood of the Liao-water.  Happening there \nto meet with the man whose name is not known, \nhe put a question to him, saying, 'I beg to ask what should be done \nin order to (carry on) the government of the world.' The nameless man said, 'Go away; \nyou are a rude borderer. Why do you put to me a question for which you are unprepared? \nI would simply play the part of the Maker of (all) things. \nWhen wearied, I would mount on the bird of the light and empty air, proceed beyond the \nsix cardinal points, and wander in the region of nonentity, to dwell in the wilderness \nof desert space. What method have you, moreover, for the government of the world that \nyou (thus) agitate my mind?' (Thien Kan), however, again asked the question, and the nameless \nman said, 'Let your mind find its enjoyment in pure simplicity; blend yourself with (the \nprimary) ether in idle indifference; allow all things to take their natural course; and \nadmit no personal or selfish consideration:—do this and the world will be governed.' \n\n4. Yang Dze-ku, having \nan interview with Lao Tan, said to him, 'Here is a man, alert and vigorous  \nin responding to all matters, \nclearsighted and widely intelligent, and an unwearied student of the Tao;—can he \nbe compared to one of the intelligent kings?' The reply was, 'Such a man is to one of \nthe intelligent kings but as the bustling underling of a court who toils his body and \ndistresses his mind with his various contrivances. \nAnd moreover, it is the beauty of the skins of the tiger and leopard which makes men hunt \nthem; the agility of the monkey, or (the sagacity of) the dog that catches the yak, which \nmake men lead them in strings; but can one similarly endowed be compared to the intelligent \nkings?' \n\nYang dze-ku looked discomposed and said, 'I venture to ask you what the government of \nthe intelligent kings is.' Lao Tan replied, 'In the governing of the intelligent kings, \ntheir services overspread all under the sky, but they did not seem to consider it as proceeding \nfrom themselves; their transforming influence reached to all things, but the people did \nnot refer it to them with hope. No one could tell the name of their agency, but they made \nmen and things be joyful in themselves. Where they took their stand could not be fathomed, \nand they found their enjoyment in (the realm of) nonentity.' \n\n5. In Kang there was a mysterious wizard \ncalled  Ki-hsien. He knew all about the deaths and births of \nmen, their preservation and ruin, their misery and happiness, and whether their lives \nwould be long or short, foretelling the year, the month, the decade and the day like a \nspirit. When the people of Kang saw him, they all ran out of his way. Lieh Tzu went to \nsee him, and was fascinated \nby him. Returning, he told Hu Tzu of his interview, and said, 'I considered your doctrine, \nmy master, to be perfect, but I have found another which is superior to it.' Hu Tzu \nreplied, 'I have communicated to you but the outward letter of my doctrine, and have not \ncommunicated its reality and spirit; and do you think that you are in possession of it? \nHowever many hens there be, if there be not the cock among them, how should they lay (real) \neggs? When you confront \nthe world with your doctrine, you are sure to show in your countenance (all that is in \nyour mind), and so enable \n(this) man to succeed in interpreting your physiognomy. Try and come to me with him, that \nI may show myself to him.' \n\nOn the morrow, accordingly, Lieh Tzu came with the man and saw Ha Tzu. When they went \nout, the  wizard said, 'Alas! your master is a dead man. He will \nnot live;—not for ten days more! I saw something strange about him;—I saw \nthe ashes (of his life) all slaked with water!' When Lieh Tzu reentered, he wept till \nthe front of his jacket was wet with his tears, and told Hu Tzu what the man had said. \nHu Tzu said, 'I showed myself to him with the forms of (vegetation beneath) the earth. \nThere were the sprouts indeed, but without (any appearance of) growth or regularity:—he \nseemed to see me with the springs of my (vital) power closed up. Try and come to me with \nhim again.' \n\nNext day, accordingly, Lieh Tzu brought the man again and saw Hu Tzu. When they went out, \nthe man said, 'It is a fortunate thing for your master that he met with me. He will get \nbetter; he has all the signs of living! I saw the balance (of the springs of life) that \nhad been stopped (inclining in his favour).' Lieh Tzu went in, and reported these words \nto his master, who said, 'I showed myself to him after the pattern of the earth (beneath \nthe) sky. Neither semblance nor reality entered (into my exhibition), but the springs \n(of life) were issuing from beneath my feet;—he seemed to see me with the springs \nof vigorous action in full play. Try and come with him again.' \n\nNext day Lieh Tzu came with the man again, and again saw Hu Tzu with him. When they went \nout, the wizard said, 'Your master is never the same. I cannot understand his physiognomy. \nLet him try to steady himself, and I will again view him.' Lieh Tzu went in and reported \nthis to Hu Tzu, who said, 'This time I showed myself to him after the pattern of the grand \nharmony (of the two elemental  forces), with the superiority \ninclining to neither. He seemed to see me with the springs of (vital) power in equal balance. \nWhere the water wheels about from (the movements of) a dugong, \nthere is an abyss; where it does so from the arresting (of its course), there is an abyss; \nwhere it does so, and the water keeps flowing on, there is an abyss. There are nine abysses \nwith their several names, and I have only exhibited three of them. Try and come with him \nagain.' \n\nNext day they came, and they again saw Hu Tzu. But before he had settled himself in his \nposition, the wizard lost himself and ran away. 'Pursue him,' said Hu Tzu, and Lieh Tzu \ndid so, but could not come up with him. He returned, and told Hu Tzu, saying, 'There is \nan end of him; he is lost; I could not find him.' Hu Tzu rejoined, 'I was showing him \nmyself after the pattern of what was before I began to come from my author. I confronted \nhim with pure vacancy, and an easy indifference. He did not know what I meant to represent. \nNow he thought it was the idea of exhausted strength, and now that of an onward flow, \nand therefore he ran away. \n\nAfter this, Lieh Tzu considered that he had not yet begun to learn (his master's doctrine). \nHe returned to his house, and for three years did not go out. He did the cooking for his \nwife. He fed the pigs as if he were feeding men. He took no part  \nor interest in occurring affairs. He put away the carving and sculpture about him, and \nreturned to pure simplicity. Like a clod of earth he stood there in his bodily presence. \nAmid all distractions he was (silent) and shut up in himself. And in this way he continued \nto the end of his life. \n\n6. Non-action (makes its exemplifier) the lord of all fame; non-action (serves him as) \nthe treasury of all plans; non-action (fits him for) the burden of all offices; non-action \n(makes him) the lord of all wisdom. \nThe range of his action is inexhaustible, but there is nowhere any trace of his presence. \nHe fulfils all that he has received from Heaven, \nbut he does not see that he was the recipient of anything. A pure vacancy (of all purpose) \nis what characterises him. When the perfect man employs his mind, it is a mirror. It conducts \nnothing and anticipates nothing; it responds to (what is before it), but does not retain \nit. Thus he is able to deal successfully with all things, and injures none. \n\n7. The Ruler of the Southern \nOcean was Shu, the  \nRuler of the Northern Ocean was Hu, \nand the Ruler of the Centre was Chaos. Shu and Hu were continually meeting in the land \nof Chaos, who treated them very well. They consulted together how they might repay his \nkindness, and said, 'Men all have seven orifices for the purpose of seeing, hearing, eating, \nand breathing, while this (poor) Ruler alone has not one. Let us try and make them for \nhim.' Accordingly they dug one orifice in him every day; and at the end of seven days \nChaos died. \n"

    "BOOK VIII. PHIEN MÂU.": "\n1. A ligament uniting the big toe with the other toes and an extra finger may be natural growths, but they are more than is good for use. Excrescences on the person \nand hanging tumours are growths from the body, but they are unnatural additions to it. \nThere are many arts of benevolence and righteousness, and the exercise of them is distributed \namong the five viscera; \nbut this is not the correct method according to the characteristics of the Tao. Thus it \nis that the addition to the foot is but the attachment to it of so much useless flesh, \nand the addition to the hand is but the planting on it of a useless finger. (So it is \nthat) the connecting (the virtues) with the five viscera renders, by excess or restraint, \nthe action of benevolence and righteousness bad, and leads to many arts as in the employment \nof (great) powers of hearing or of vision. \n\n2. Therefore an extraordinary power of vision  leads to the confusion \nof the five colours and \nan excessive use of ornament. (Its possessor), in the resplendence of his green and yellow, \nwhite and black, black and green, will not stop till he has become a Li Ku. An extraordinary power of hearing leads to a confusion of the five notes, and an excessive use of the six musical accords. (Its possessor), in bringing out the tones from the instruments of metal, \nstone, silk, and bamboo, aided by the Hwang-kung \nand Ta-lu (tubes), will not stop till he has \nbecome a Shih Khwang. \n(So), excessive benevolence eagerly brings out virtues and restrains its (proper) nature, \nthat (its possessor) may acquire a famous reputation, and cause all the organs and drums \nin the world to celebrate an unattainable condition; and he will not stop till he has \nbecome a Zang (Shan) \nor a Shih (Zhiu). An \nextraordinary  faculty in debating leads to the piling up of \narguments like a builder with his bricks, or a net-maker with his string. (Its possessor) \ncunningly contrives his sentences and enjoys himself in discussing what hardness is and \nwhat whiteness is, where views agree and where they differ, and pressing on, though weary, \nwith short steps, with (a multitude of) useless words to make good his opinion; nor will \nhe stop till he has become a Yang (Ku) \nor Mo (Ti). But in all these cases the parties, \nwith their redundant and divergent methods, do not proceed by that which is the correct \npath for all under the sky. That which is the perfectly correct path is not to lose the \nreal character of the nature with which we are endowed. Hence the union (of parts) should \nnot be considered redundance, nor their divergence superfluity; what is long should not \nbe considered too long, nor what is short too short. A duck's legs, for instance, are \nshort, but if we try to lengthen them, it occasions pain; and a crane's legs are long, \nbut if we try to cut off a portion of them, it produces grief. Where a part is by nature \nlong, we are not to amputate, or where it is by nature short, we are not to lengthen it. \nThere is no occasion to try to remove any trouble that it may cause. \n\n3. The presumption is that benevolence and righteousness are not constituents of humanity; \nfor to how much anxiety does the exercise of them give rise! Moreover when another toe \nis united to the  great toe, to divide the membrane makes you \nweep; and when there is an extra finger, to gnaw it off makes you cry out. In the one \ncase there is a member too many, and in the other a member too few; but the anxiety and \npain which they cause is the same. The benevolent men of the present age look at the evils \nof the world, as with eyes full of dust, and are filled with sorrow by them, while those \nwho are not benevolent, having violently altered the character of their proper nature, \ngreedily pursue after riches and honours. The presumption therefore is that benevolence \nand righteousness are contrary to the nature of man:—how full of trouble and contention \nhas the world been ever since the three dynasties \nbegan! \n\nAnd moreover, in employing the hook and line, the compass and square, to give things their \ncorrect form you must cut away portions of what naturally belongs to them; in employing \nstrings and fastenings, glue and varnish to make things firm, you must violently interfere \nwith their qualities. The bendings and stoppings in ceremonies and music, and the factitious \nexpression in the countenance of benevolence and righteousness, in order to comfort the \nminds of men:—these all show a failure in observing the regular principles (of the \nhuman constitution). All men are furnished with such regular principles; and according \nto them what is bent is not made so by the hook, nor what is straight by the line, nor \nwhat is round by the compass, nor what is square by the carpenter's square. Nor is adhesion \neffected by  the use of glue and varnish, nor are things bound \ntogether by means of strings and bands. Thus it is that all in the world are produced \nwhat they are by a certain guidance, while they do not know how they are produced so; \nand they equally attain their several ends while they do not know how it is that they \ndo so. Anciently it was so, and it is so now; and this constitution of things should not \nbe made of none effect. Why then should benevolence and righteousness be employed as connecting \n(links), or as glue and varnish, strings and bands, and the enjoyment arising from the \nTao and its characteristics be attributed to them?—it is a deception practised upon \nthe world. Where the deception is small, there will be a change in the direction (of the \nobjects pursued); where it is great, there will be a change of the nature itself. How \ndo I know that it is so? Since he of the line of Yu called in his benevolence and righteousness \nto distort and vex the world, the world has not ceased to hurry about to execute their \ncommands;—has not this been by means of benevolence and righteousness to change \n(men's views) of their nature? \n\n4. I will therefore try and discuss this matter. From the commencement of the three dynasties \ndownwards, nowhere has there been a man who has not under (the influence of external) \nthings altered (the course of) his nature. Small men for the sake of gain have sacrificed \ntheir persons; scholars for the sake of fame have done so; great officers, for the sake \nof their families; and sagely men, for the sake of the kingdom. These several classes, \nwith different occupations, and different reputations,  have \nagreed in doing injury to their nature and sacrificing their persons. Take the case of \na male and female slave;—they \nhave to feed the sheep together, but they both lose their sheep. Ask the one what he was \ndoing, and you will find that he was holding his bamboo tablets and reading. Ask the other, \nand you will find that she was amusing herself with some game. \nThey were differently occupied, but they equally lose their sheep. (So), Po-i \ndied at the foot of Shau-yang \nto maintain his fame, and the robber Kih \ndied on the top of Tung-ling \nin his eagerness for gain. Their deaths were occasioned by different causes, but they \nequally shortened their lives and did violence to their nature;—why must we approve \nof Po-i, and condemn the robber Kih? In cases of such sacrifice all over the world, when \none makes it for the sake of benevolence and righteousness, the common people style him \n'a superior man,' but when another does it for the sake of goods and riches, they style \nhim 'a small man.' The action of sacrificing is the same, and yet we have 'the superior \nman' and 'the small man!' In the matter of destroying his life, and doing injury to his \nnature, the robber Kih simply did the same as Po-i;—why must we make the distinction \nof 'superior man' and 'small man' between them? \n\n5. Moreover, those who devote their nature to (the pursuit) of benevolence and righteousness, \nthough they should attain to be like Zang (Shan) and Shih (Zhiu), I do not pronounce to \nbe good; those who devote it to (the study of) the five flavours, though they attain to \nbe like Shu-r, I do not \npronounce to be good; those who devote it to the (discrimination of the) five notes, though \nthey attain to be like Shih Khwang, I do not pronounce to be quick of hearing; those who \ndevote it to the (appreciation of the) five colours, though they attain to be like Li \nKu, I do not pronounce to be clear of vision. When I pronounce men to be good, I am not \nspeaking of their benevolence and righteousness;—the goodness is simply (their possession \nof) the qualities (of the Tao). When I pronounce them to be good, I am not speaking of \nwhat are called benevolence and righteousness; but simply of their allowing the nature \nwith which they are endowed to have its free course. When I pronounce men to be quick \nof hearing, I do not mean that they hearken to anything else, but that they hearken to \nthemselves; when I pronounce them to be clear of vision, I do not mean that they look \nto anything else, but that they look to themselves. Now those who do not see themselves \nbut see other things, who do not get possession of themselves but get possession of other \nthings, get possession of what belongs to others, and not of what is their own; and they \nreach forth to what attracts others, and not to that in themselves which should attract \nthem. But  thus reaching forth to what attracts others and not \nto what should attract them in themselves, be they like the robber Kih or like Po-i, they \nequally err in the way of excess or of perversity. What I am ashamed of is erring in the \ncharacteristics of the Tao, and therefore, in the higher sphere, I do not dare to insist \non the practice of benevolence and righteousness, and, in the lower, I do not dare to \nallow myself either in the exercise of excess or perversity. \n"

    "BOOK IX MÂ THÎ.": "\n1. Horses can with their hoofs tread on the hoarfrost and snow, and with their hair withstand \nthe wind and cold; they feed on the grass and drink water; they prance with their legs \nand leap:—this is the true nature of horses. Though there were made for them grand \ntowers and large dormitories, \nthey would prefer not to use them. But when Po-lao (arose and) said, 'I know well how to manage horses,' (men proceeded) to singe and mark them, to clip their hair, to pare their hoofs, to halter \ntheir heads, to bridle them and hobble them, and to confine them in stables and corrals. \n(When subjected to this treatment), two or three in every ten of them died. (Men proceeded \nfurther) to subject them to hunger and thirst, to gallop them and race them,  \nand to make them go together in regular order. In front were the evils of the bit and \nornamented breast-bands, and behind were the terrors of the whip and switch. (When so \ntreated), more than half of them died. \n\nThe (first) potter said, 'I know well how to deal with clay;' and (men proceeded) to mould \nit into circles as exact as if made by the compass, and into squares as exact as if formed \nby the measuring square. The (first) carpenter said, 'I know well how to deal with wood;' \nand (men proceeded) to make it bent as if by the application of the hook, and straight \nas if by the application of the plumb-line. But is it the nature of clay and wood to require \nthe application of the compass and square, of the hook and line? And yet age after age \nmen have praised Po-lao, saying, 'He knew well how to manage horses,' and also the (first) \npotter and carpenter, saying, 'They knew well how to deal with clay and wood.' This is \njust the error committed by the governors of the world. \n\n2. According to my idea, those who knew well to govern mankind would not act so. The people \nhad their regular and constant nature:—they wove and made themselves clothes; they tilled the ground and got \nfood. This was their \ncommon faculty. They were all one in this, and did not form themselves into separate classes; \nso were they constituted and left to their natural tendencies. Therefore in the  age of perfect virtue men walked \nalong with slow and grave step, and with their looks steadily directed forwards. At that \ntime, on the hills there were no foot-paths, nor excavated passages; on the lakes there \nwere no boats nor dams; all creatures lived in companies; and the places of their settlement \nwere made close to one another. Birds and beasts multiplied to flocks and herds; the grass \nand trees grew luxuriant and long. In this condition the birds and beasts might be led \nabout without feeling the constraint; the nest of the magpie might be climbed to, and \npeeped into. Yes, in the age of perfect virtue, men lived in common with birds and beasts, \nand were on terms of equality with all creatures, as forming one family;—how could \nthey know among themselves the distinctions of superior men and small men? Equally without \nknowledge, they did not leave (the path of) their natural virtue; equally free from desires, \nthey were in the state of pure simplicity. In that state of pure simplicity, the nature \nof the people was what it ought to be. But when the sagely men appeared, limping and wheeling \nabout in (the exercise of) benevolence, pressing along and standing on tiptoe in the doing \nof righteousness, then men universally began to be perplexed. (Those sages also) went \nto excess in their performances of music, and in their gesticulations in the practice \nof ceremonies, and then men began to be separated from one another. If the raw materials \n had not been cut and hacked, who could have made a sacrificial \nvase from them? If the natural jade had not been broken and injured, who could have made \nthe handles for the libation-cups from it? If the attributes of the Tao had not been disallowed, \nhow should they have preferred benevolence and righteousness? If the instincts of the \nnature had not been departed from, how should ceremonies and music have come into use? \nIf the five colours had not been confused, how should the ornamental figures have been \nformed? If the five notes had not been confused, how should they have supplemented them \nby the musical accords? The cutting and hacking of the raw materials to form vessels was \nthe crime of the skilful workman; the injury done to the characteristics of the Tao in \norder to the practice of benevolence and righteousness was the error of the sagely men. \n\n3. Horses, when living in the open country, eat the grass, and drink water; when pleased, \nthey intertwine their necks and rub one another; when enraged, they turn back to back \nand kick one another;—this is all that they know to do. But if we put the yoke on \ntheir necks, with the moonlike frontlet displayed on all their foreheads, then they know \nto look slily askance, to curve their necks, to rush viciously, trying to get the bit \nout of their mouths, and to filch the reins (from their driver);—this knowledge \nof the horse and its ability thus to act the part of a thief is the crime of Po-lao. In \nthe time of (the Ti) Ho-hsu, \nthe people occupied  their dwellings without knowing what they \nwere doing, and walked out without knowing where they were going. They filled their mouths \nwith food and were glad; they slapped their stomachs to express their satisfaction. This \nwas all the ability which they possessed. But when the sagely men appeared, with their \nbendings and stoppings in ceremonies and music to adjust the persons of all, and hanging \nup their benevolence and righteousness to excite the endeavours of all to reach them, \nin order to comfort their minds, then the people began to stump and limp about in their \nlove of knowledge, and strove with one another in their pursuit of gain, so that there \nwas no stopping them:—this was the error of those sagely men. \n"

    "BOOK X. KHÜ KHIEH.": "\n1. In taking precautions against thieves who cut open satchels, search bags, and break \nopen boxes, people are sure to cord and fasten them well, and to employ strong bonds and \nclasps; and in this they are ordinarily said to show their wisdom. When a great thief \ncomes, however, he shoulders the box, lifts up the satchel, carries off the bag, and runs \naway with them, afraid only that the cords, bonds, and clasps may not be secure; and in \nthis case what was called the wisdom (of the owners) proves to be nothing but a collecting \nof the things for the great thief. Let me try and set this matter forth. Do not those \nwho are vulgarly called wise prove to be collectors for the great thieves? And do not \nthose who are called sages prove to be but guardians in the interest of the great thieves? \n\nHow do I know that the case is so? Formerly, in the state of Khi, the neighbouring towns \ncould see one another; their cocks and dogs never ceased to answer the crowing and barking \nof other cocks and dogs (between them). The nets were set (in the water and on the land); \nand the ploughs and hoes were employed over more than a space of two thousand li square. \nAll within its four boundaries, the  establishment of the ancestral \ntemples and of the altars of the land and grain, and the ordering of the hamlets and houses, \nand of every corner in the districts, large, medium, and small, were in all particulars \naccording to the rules of the sages. So it was; but yet one morning, Thien Khang Tzu killed the ruler of Khi, and stole his state. And was it only the state that \nhe stole? Along with it he stole also the regulations of the sages and wise men (observed \nin it). And so, though he got the name of being a thief and a robber, yet he himself continued \nto live as securely as Yao and Shun had done. Small states did not dare to find fault \nwith him; great states did not dare to take him off; for twelve generations (his descendants) \nhave possessed the state of Khi. Thus do we not have a case in which not only did (the party) steal the state \nof Khi,  but at the same time the regulations of its sages and \nwise men, which thereby served to guard the person of him, thief and robber as he was? \n\n2. Let me try to set forth this subject (still further). Have not there been among those \nvulgarly styled the wisest, such as have collected (their wealth) for the great chief? \nand among those styled the most sage such as have guarded it for him? How do I know that \nit has been so? Formerly, Lung-fang was beheaded; Pi-kan had his heart torn out; Khang Hung was ripped open; and Dze-hsu was reduced to pulp (in the Kiang). Worthy as those four men were, they did \nnot escape such dreadful deaths. The followers of the robber Kih asked him, saying, 'Has the robber also any method or principle (in his proceedings)?' \nHe replied, 'What profession is there which has not its principles? That the robber in \nhis recklessness comes to the conclusion that there are valuable deposits in an apartment \nshows his sageness; that he is the first to enter it shows his bravery; that he is the \nlast to quit it shows his righteousness; that he knows whether (the robbery) may be attempted \nor not shows his wisdom; and that he makes an equal  division \nof the plunder shows his benevolence. Without all these five qualities no one in the world \nhas ever attained to become a great robber.' Looking at the subject in this way, we see \nthat good men do not arise without having the principles of the sages, and that Kih could \nnot have pursued his course without the same principles. But the good men in the world \nare few, and those who are not good are many;—it follows that the sages benefit \nthe world in a few instances and injure it in many. Hence it is that we have the sayings, \n'When the lips are gone the teeth are cold;' \n'The poor wine of Lu gave occasion to the siege of Han-tan;' \n'When sages are born great robbers arise.' \nWhen the stream is dried, the valley is empty; when the mound is levelled, the deep pool \n(beside it) is filled up. When the sages have died, the great robbers will not arise; \nthe world would be at peace, and there would be no more troubles. While the sagely men \nhave not died, great robbers will not cease to appear. The more right that is attached \nto (the views of) the sagely men for the government of the world, the more advantage will \naccrue to (such men as) the robber Kih. If we make for men pecks and bushels  \nto measure (their wares), even by means of those pecks and bushels should we be teaching \nthem to steal; if we \nmake for them weights and steelyards to weigh (their wares), even by means of those weights \nand steelyards shall we be teaching them to steal. If we make for them tallies and seals \nto secure their good faith, even by means of those tallies and seals shall we be teaching \nthem to steal. If we make for them benevolence and righteousness to make their doings \ncorrect, even by means of benevolence and righteousness shall we be teaching them to steal. \nHow do I know that it is so? Here is one who steals a hook (for his girdle);—he \nis put to death for it: here is another who steals a state;—he becomes its prince. \nBut it is at the gates of the princes that we find benevolence and righteousness (most \nstrongly) professed;—is not this stealing benevolence and righteousness, sageness \nand wisdom? Thus they hasten to become great robbers, carry off princedoms, and steal \nbenevolence and righteousness, with all the gains springing from the use of pecks and \nbushels, weights and steelyards, tallies and seals:—even the rewards of carriages \nand coronets have no power to influence (to a different course), and the terrors of the \naxe have no power to restrain in such cases. The giving of so great gain to robbers (like) \nKih, and making it impossible to restrain them;—this is the error committed by the \nsages. \n\n3. In accordance with this it is said, 'Fish should  not be taken \nfrom (the protection of) the deep waters; the agencies for the profit of a state should \nnot be shown to men.' \nBut those sages (and their teachings) are the agencies for the profit of the world, and \nshould not be exhibited to it. Therefore if an end were put to sageness and wisdom put \naway, the great robbers would cease to arise. If jade were put away and pearls broken \nto bits, the small thieves would not appear. If tallies were burned and seals broken in \npieces, the people would become simple and unsophisticated. If pecks were destroyed and \nsteelyards snapped in two, the people would have no wrangling. If the rules of the sages \nwere entirely set aside in the world, a beginning might be made of reasoning with the \npeople. If the six musical accords were reduced to a state of utter confusion, organs \nand lutes all burned, and the ears of the (musicians like the) blind Khwang \nstopped up, all men would begin to possess and employ their (natural) power of hearing. \nIf elegant ornaments were abolished, the five embellishing colours disused, and the eyes \nof (men like) Li Ku glued \nup, all men would begin to possess and employ their (natural) power of vision. If the \nhook and line were destroyed, the compass and square thrown away, and the fingers of men \n(like) the artful Khui \nsmashed, all men would begin to possess and employ their (natural) skill;—as it \nis said, 'The greatest art is  like stupidity.' \nIf conduct such as that of Za(Shan) \nand Shih (Khiu) were \ndiscarded, the mouths of Yang (Ku) \nand Mo (Ti) gagged, and benevolence and righteousness seized and thrown aside, the virtue \nof all men would begin to display its mysterious excellence. When men possessed and employed \ntheir (natural) power of vision, there would be no distortion in the world. When they \npossessed and employed their (natural) power of hearing, there would be no distractions \nin the world. When they possessed and employed their (natural) faculty of knowledge, there \nwould be no delusions in the world. When they possessed and employed their (natural) virtue, \nthere would be no depravity in the world. Men like Zang (Shan), Shih (Khiu), Yang (Ku), \nMo (Ti), Shih Khwang (the musician), the artist Khui, and Li Ku, all display their qualities \noutwardly, and set the world in a blaze (of admiration) and confound it;—a method \nwhich is of no use! \n\n4. Are you, Sir, unacquainted with the age of perfect virtue? Anciently there were Yung-khang, \nTa-thing, Po-hwang, Kang-yang, Li-lu, Li-khu, Hsien-yuan, Ho-hsu, Zun-lu, Ku-yung, Fu-hsi, \nand Shan-nang. In their \ntimes the people made  knots on cords in carrying on their affairs. \nThey thought their (simple) food pleasant, and their (plain) clothing beautiful. They \nwere happy in their (simple) manners, and felt at rest in their (poor) dwellings. (The \npeople of) neighbouring states might be able to descry one another; the voices of their \ncocks and dogs might be heard (all the way) from one to the other; they might not die \ntill they were old; and yet all their life they would have no communication together. \nIn those times perfect good order prevailed. \n\nNow-a-days, however, such is the state of things that you shall see the people stretching \nout their necks, and standing on tiptoe, while they say, 'In such and such a place there \nis a wise and able man.' Then they carry with them whatever dry provisions they may have \nleft, and hurry towards it, abandoning their parents in their homes, and neglecting the \nservice of their rulers abroad. Their footsteps may be traced in lines from one state \nto another, and the ruts of their chariot-wheels also for more than a thousand li. This \nis owing to the error of their superiors in their (inordinate) fondness for knowledge. \nWhen those superiors do really love knowledge, but do not follow the (proper) course, \nthe whole world is thrown into great confusion. \n\nHow do I know that the case is so? The knowledge shown in the (making of) bows, cross-bows, \nhand-nets, stringed arrows, and contrivances with springs is great, but the birds are \ntroubled by them  above; the knowledge shown in the hooks, baits, \nvarious kinds of nets, and bamboo traps is great, but the fishes are disturbed by them \nin the waters; the knowledge shown in the arrangements for setting nets, and the nets \nand snares themselves, is great, but the animals are disturbed by them in the marshy grounds. \n(So), the versatility shown in artful deceptions becoming more and more pernicious, in \ningenious discussions as to what is hard and what is white, and in attempts to disperse \nthe dust and reconcile different views, is great, but the common people are perplexed \nby all the sophistry. Hence there is great disorder continually in the world, and the \nguilt of it is due to that fondness for knowledge. Thus it is that all men know to seek \nfor the knowledge that they have not attained to; and do not know to seek for that which \nthey already have (in themselves); and that they know to condemn what they do not approve \n(in others), and do not know to condemn what they have allowed in themselves;—it \nis this which occasions the great confusion and disorder. It is just as if, above, the \nbrightness of the sun and moon were darkened; as if, beneath, the productive vigour of \nthe hills and streams were dried up; and as if, between, the operation of the four seasons \nwere brought to an end:—in which case there would not be a single weak and wriggling \ninsect, nor any plant that grows up, which would not lose its proper nature. Great indeed \nis the disorder produced in the world by the love of knowledge. From the time of the three \ndynasties downwards it has been so. The plain and honest-minded people are neglected, \nand the plausible representations of restless spirits  received \nwith pleasure; the quiet and unexciting method of non-action is put away, and pleasure \ntaken in ideas garrulously expressed. It is this garrulity of speech which puts the world \nin disorder. \n"

The government of the \nworld by Kieh, (on the contrary), made men look distressed; but when their nature shows \nthe symptoms of distress, there is a want of its (proper) contentment. The want of placidity \nand the want of contentment are contrary to the character (of the nature); and where this \nobtains, it is impossible that any man or state should anywhere abide long.

When those elements thus predominate in men, (it is as if) the four seasons were not to come (at their proper times), and the harmony \nof cold and heat were not to be maintained;—would there not result injury to the \nbodies of men? Men's joy and dissatisfaction are made to arise where they ought not to \ndo so; their movements are all uncertain; they lose the mastery of their thoughts; they \nstop short midway, and do not finish what they have begun. In this state of things the \nworld begins to have lofty aims, and jealous dislikes, ambitious courses, and fierce animosities, \nand then we have actions like those of the robber Kih, or of Zang (Shan) and Shih (Zhiu). If now the whole world were taken to reward the good it would not suffice, \nnor would it be possible with it to punish the bad. Thus the world, great as it is, not \nsufficing for rewards and punishments, from the time of the three dynasties downwards, \nthere has been nothing but bustle and excitement. Always occupied with rewards and punishments, \nwhat leisure have men had to rest in the instincts of the nature with which they are endowed? \n\n2. Moreover, delight in the power of vision leads  to excess \nin the pursuit of (ornamental) colours; delight in the power of hearing, to excess in \nseeking (the pleasures of) sound; delight in benevolence tends to disorder that virtue \n(as proper to the nature); delight in righteousness sets the man in opposition to what \nis right in reason; delight in (the practice of) ceremonies is helpful to artful forms; \ndelight in music leads to voluptuous airs; delight in sageness is helpful to ingenious \ncontrivances; delight in knowledge contributes to fault-finding. If all men were to rest \nin the instincts of their nature, to keep or to extinguish these eight delights might \nbe a matter of indifference; but if they will not rest in those instincts, then those \neight delights begin to be imperfectly and unevenly developed or violently suppressed, \nand the world is thrown into disorder. But when men begin to honour them, and to long \nfor them, how great is the deception practised on the world! And not only, when (a performance \nof them) is once over, do they not have done with them, but they prepare themselves (as) \nwith fasting to describe them, they seem to kneel reverentially when they bring them forward, \nand they go through them with the excitements of music and singing; and then what can \nbe done (to remedy the evil of them)? Therefore the superior man, who feels himself constrained \nto engage in the administration of the world will find it his best way to do nothing. In (that policy of) doing nothing, he can rest in the instincts of the nature \nwith which he is endowed. Hence he who will administer (the government of) the world  \nhonouring it as he honours his own person, may have that government committed to him, \nand he who will administer it loving it as he loves his own person, may have it entrusted \nto him. Therefore, if \nthe superior man will keep (the faculties lodged in) his five viscera unemployed, and \nnot display his powers of seeing and hearing, while he is motionless as a representative \nof the dead, his dragon-like presence will be seen; while he is profoundly silent, the \nthunder (of his words) will resound, while his movements are (unseen) like those of a \nspirit, all heavenly influences will follow them; while he is (thus) unconcerned and does \nnothing, his genial influence will attract and gather all things round him:—what \nleisure has he to do anything more for the government of the world? \n\n3. Zhui Khu asked Lao \nTan, saying, 'If you do not govern the world, how can you make men's minds good?' The \nreply was, 'Take care how you meddle with and disturb men's minds. The mind, if pushed \nabout, gets depressed; if helped forward, it gets exalted. Now exalted, now depressed, \nhere it appears as a prisoner, and there as a wrathful fury. (At one time) it becomes \npliable and soft, yielding to what is hard and strong; (at another), it is sharp as the \nsharpest corner, fit to carve or chisel (stone or jade). Now it is hot as a scorching \nfire, and anon it is cold as ice. It is so swift that while one is bending down and lifting \nup his head, it shall twice  have put forth a soothing hand beyond \nthe four seas. Resting, it is still as a deep abyss; moving, it is like one of the bodies \nin the sky; in its resolute haughtiness, it refuses to be bound;—such is the mind \nof man!' \n\nAnciently, Hwang-Ti was the first to meddle with and disturb the mind of man with his \nbenevolence and righteousness. \nAfter him, Yao and Shun wore their thighs bare and the hair off the calves of their legs, \nin their labours to nourish the bodies of the people. They toiled painfully with all the \npowers in their five viscera at the practice of their benevolence and righteousness; they \ntasked their blood and breath to make out a code of laws;—and after all they were \nunsuccessful. On this Yao sent away Hwan Tau to Khung hill, and (the Chiefs of) the Three \nMiao to San-wei, and banished the Minister of Works to the Dark Capital; so unequal had \nthey been to cope with the world. Then we are carried on to the kings of the Three (dynasties), when the world \nwas in a state of great distraction. Of the lowest type of character there were Kieh and \nKih; of a higher type there were Zang (Shan) and Shih (Zhiu). At the same time there arose \nthe classes of  the Literati and the Mohists. Hereupon, complacency \nin, and hatred of, one another produced mutual suspicions; the stupid and the wise imposed \non one another; the good and the bad condemned one another; the boastful and the sincere \ninterchanged their recriminations;—and the world fell into decay. Views as to what \nwas greatly virtuous did not agree, and the nature with its endowments became as if shrivelled \nby fire or carried away by a flood. All were eager for knowledge, and the people were \nexhausted with their searchings (after what was good). On this the axe and the saw were \nbrought into play; guilt was determined as by the plumb-line and death inflicted; the \nhammer and gouge did their work. The world fell into great disorder, and presented the \nappearance of a jagged mountain ridge. The crime to which all was due was the meddling \nwith and disturbing men's minds. The effect was that men of ability and worth lay concealed \nat the foot of the crags of mount Thai, and princes of ten thousand chariots were anxious \nand terrified in their ancestral temples. In the present age those Who have been put to \ndeath in various ways lie thick as if pillowed on each other; those who are wearing the \ncangue press on each other (on the roads); those who are suffering the bastinado can see \neach other (all over the land). And now the Literati and the Mohists begin to stand, on \ntiptoe and with bare arms, among the fettered and manacled crowd! Ah! extreme is their \nshamelessness, and their failure to see the disgrace! Strange that we should be slow to \nrecognise their sageness and wisdom in the bars of the cangue, and their benevolence and \nrighteousness in the rivets of the fetters and handcuffs! How do we know that  \nZang and Shih are not the whizzing arrows of Kieh and Kih? \nTherefore it is said, 'Abolish sageness and cast away knowledge, and the world will be \nbrought to a state of great order.' \n\n4. Hwang-Ti had been on the throne for nineteen years, \nand his ordinances were in operation all through the kingdom, when he heard that Kwang \nKhang Tzu was living \non the summit of Khung-thung, \nand went to see him. 'I have heard,' he said, 'that you, Sir, are well acquainted with \nthe perfect Tao. I venture to ask you what is the essential thing in it. I wish to take \nthe subtlest influences of heaven and earth, and assist with them the (growth of the) \nfive cereals for the (better) nourishment of the people. I also wish to direct the (operation \nof the) Yin and Yang, so as to secure the comfort of all living beings. How shall I proceed \nto accomplish those objects?' Kwang Khang Tzu replied, 'What you wish to ask about is \nthe original substance of all things; \nwhat you  wish to have the direction of is that substance as \nit was shattered and divided. \nAccording to your government of the world, the vapours of the clouds, before they were \ncollected, would descend in rain; the herbs and trees would shed their leaves before they \nbecame yellow; and the light of the sun and moon would hasten to extinction. Your mind \nis that of a flatterer with his plausible words;—it is not fit that I should tell \nyou the perfect Tao.' \n\nHwang-Ti withdrew, gave up (his government of) the kingdom, built himself a solitary apartment, \nspread in it a mat of the white mao grass, dwelt in it unoccupied for three months, and \nthen went again to seek an interview with (the recluse). Kwang Khang Tzu was then lying \ndown with his head to the south. Hwang-Ti, with an air of deferential submission, went \nforward on his knees, twice bowed low with his face to the ground, and asked him, saying, \n'I have heard that you, Sir, are well acquainted with the perfect Tao;—I venture \nto ask how I should rule my body, in order that it may continue for a long time.' Kwang \nKhang Tzu hastily rose, and said, 'A good question! Come and I will tell you the perfect \nTao. Its essence is (surrounded with) the deepest obscurity; its highest reach is in darkness \nand silence. There is nothing to be seen; nothing to be heard. When it holds the spirit \nin its arms in stillness, then the bodily form of itself will become correct. You must \nbe still; you must be pure; not subjecting your body to toil, not agitating your vital \nforce;—then you may live for long. When  your eyes see \nnothing, your ears hear nothing, and your mind knows nothing, your spirit will keep your \nbody, and the body will live long. Watch over what is within you, shut up the avenues \nthat connect you with what is external;—much knowledge is pernicious. I (will) proceed \nwith you to the summit of the Grand Brilliance, where we come to the source of the bright \nand expanding (element); I will enter with you the gate of the Deepest Obscurity, where \nwe come to the source of the dark and repressing (element). There heaven and earth have \ntheir controllers; there the Yin and Yang have their Repositories. Watch over and keep \nyour body, and all things will of themselves give it vigour. I maintain the (original) \nunity (of these elements), and dwell in the harmony of them. In this way 1 have cultivated \nmyself for one thousand and two hundred years, and my bodily form has undergone no decay.' \n\nHwang-Ti twice bowed low with his head to the ground, and said, 'In Kwang Khang Tzu we \nhave an example of what is called Heaven.' \nThe other said, 'Come, and I will tell you:—(The perfect Tao) is something inexhaustible, \nand yet men all think it has an end; it is something unfathomable, and yet men all think \nits extreme limit can be reached. He who attains to my Tao, if he be in a high position, \nwill be one of the August ones, and in a low position, will be a king. He who fails in \nattaining it, in his highest attainment will see the light, but will  \ndescend and be of the Earth. At present all things are produced from the Earth and return \nto the Earth. Therefore I will leave you, and enter the gate of the Unending, to enjoy \nmyself in the fields of the Illimitable. I will blend my light with that of the sun and \nmoon, and will endure while heaven and earth endure. If men agree with my views, I will \nbe unconscious of it; if they keep far apart from them, I will be unconscious of it; they \nmay all die, and I will abide alone!' \n\n5. Yun Kiang, rambling \nto the east, having been borne along on a gentle breeze, \nsuddenly encountered Hung Mung, who was rambling \nabout, slapping his buttocks \nand hopping like a bird. Amazed at the sight, Yun Kiang stood reverentially, and said \nto the other, 'Venerable Sir, who are you? and why are you doing this?' Hung Mung went \non slapping his buttocks and hopping like a bird, but replied, 'I am enjoying myself.' \nYun Kiang said, 'I  wish to ask you a question.' Hung Mung lifted \nup his head, looked at the stranger, and said, 'Pooh!' Yun Kiang, however, continued, \n'The breath of heaven is out of harmony; the breath of earth is bound up; the six elemental \ninfluences do not act \nin concord; the four seasons do not observe their proper times. Now I wish to blend together \nthe essential qualities of those six influences in order to nourish all living things;—how \nshall I go about it?' Hung Mung slapped his buttocks, hopped about, and shook his head, \nsaying, 'I do not know; I do not know!' \n\nYun Kiang could not pursue his question; but three years afterwards, when (again) rambling \nin the east, as he was passing by the wild of Sung, he happened to meet Hung Mung. Delighted \nwith the rencontre, he hastened to him, and said, 'Have you forgotten me, O Heaven? Have \nyou forgotten me, O Heaven?' \nAt the same time, he bowed twice with his head to the ground, wishing to receive his instructions. \nHung Mung said, 'Wandering listlessly about, I know not what I seek; carried on by a wild \nimpulse, I know not where I am going. I wander about in the strange manner (which you \nhave seen), and see that nothing proceeds without method and order;—what \nmore should I know?' Yun Kiang replied, 'I also seem carried on by an aimless influence, \nand yet the people follow me wherever I go. I cannot help their doing so. But now as they \nthus  imitate me, I wish to hear a word from you (in the case).' \nThe other said, 'What disturbs the regular method of Heaven, comes into collision with \nthe nature of things, prevents the accomplishment of the mysterious (operation of) Heaven, \nscatters the herds of animals, makes the birds all sing at night, is calamitous to vegetation, \nand disastrous to all insects;—all this is owing, I conceive, to the error of governing \nmen.' 'What then,' said Yun Kiang, 'shall I do?' 'Ah,' said the other, 'you will only \ninjure them! I will leave you in my dancing way, and return to my place.' Yun Kiang rejoined, \n'It has been a difficult thing to get this meeting with you, O Heaven! I should like to \nhear from you a word (more).' Hung Mung said, 'Ah! your mind (needs to be) nourished. \nDo you only take the position of doing nothing, and things will of themselves become transformed. \nNeglect your body; cast out from you your power of hearing and sight; forget what you \nhave in common with things; cultivate a grand similarity with the chaos of the plastic \nether; unloose your mind; set your spirit free; be still as if you had no soul. Of all \nthe multitude of things every one returns to its root. Every one returns to its root, \nand does not know (that it is doing so). They all are as in the state of chaos, and during \nall their existence they do not leave it. \nIf  they knew (that they were returning to their root), they \nwould be (consciously) leaving it. They do not ask its name; they do not seek to spy out \ntheir nature; and thus it is that things come to life of themselves.' \n\nYun Kiang said, 'Heaven, you have conferred on me (the knowledge of) your operation, and \nrevealed to me the mystery of it. All my life I had been seeking for it, and now I have \nobtained it.' He then bowed twice, with his head to the ground, arose, took his leave, \nand walked away. \n\n6. The ordinary men of the world \nall rejoice in men's agreeing with themselves, and dislike men's being different from \nthemselves. This rejoicing and this dislike arise from their being bent on making themselves \ndistinguished above all others. But have they who have this object at heart so risen out \nabove all others? They depend on them to rest quietly (in the position which they desire), \nand their knowledge is not equal to the multitude of the arts of all those others! \nWhen they wish again to administer a state for its ruler, they proceed to employ all the \nmethods which the kings of the three dynasties considered profitable without seeing the \nevils of such a course. This is to make the state depend on the peradventure of their \nluck. But how seldom it is that that peradventure does not issue in the ruin of the state! \nNot once in ten thousand instances will such men preserve a state. Not once will they \nsucceed, and in more than ten thousand cases will they  ruin \nit. Alas that the possessors of territory,—(the rulers of states),—should \nnot know the danger (of employing such men)! Now the possessors of territory possess the \ngreatest of (all) things. Possessing the greatest of all things,—(possessing, that \nis, men),—they should not try to deal with them as (simply) things. And it is he \nwho is not a thing (himself) that is therefore able to deal with (all) things as they \nseverally require. When (a ruler) clearly understands that he who should so deal with \nall things is not a thing himself, will he only rule the kingdom? He will go out and in \nthroughout the universe (at his pleasure); he will roam over the nine regions, \nalone in going, alone in coming. Him we call the sole possessor (of this ability); and \nthe sole possessor (of this ability) is what is called the noblest of all. \n\nThe teaching of (this) great man goes forth as the shadow from the substance, as the echo \nresponds to the sound. When questioned, he responds, exhausting (from his own stores) \nall that is in the (enquirer's) mind, as if front to front with all under heaven. His \nresting-place gives forth no sound; his sphere of activity has no restriction of place. \nHe conducts every one to his proper goal, proceeding to it and bringing him back to it \nas by his own movement. His movements have no trace; his going forth and his re-enterings \nhave no deviation; his course is like that of the sun without beginning (or ending). \n\nIf you would praise or discourse about his personality, he is united with the great community \nof existences. He belongs to that great community, and has no individual self. Having \nno individual self, how should he have anything that can be called his? If you look at \nthose who have what they call their own, they are the superior men of former times; if \nyou look at him who has nothing of the kind, he is the friend of heaven and earth. \n\n7. Mean, and yet demanding to be allowed their free course;—such are Things. Low, \nand yet requiring to be relied on;—such are the People. Hidden (as to their issues), \nand yet requiring to be done;—such are Affairs. Coarse, and yet necessary to be \nset forth;—such are Laws. Remote, and yet necessary to have dwelling (in one's self);—such \nis Righteousness. Near, and yet necessary to be widely extended;—such is Benevolence. \nRestrictive, and yet necessary to be multiplied;—such are Ceremonies. Lodged in \nthe centre, and yet requiring to be exalted;—such is Virtue. Always One, and yet \nrequiring to be modified;—such is the Tao. Spirit-like, and yet requiring to be \nexercised;—such is Heaven. \n\nTherefore the sages contemplated Heaven, but did not assist It. They tried to perfect \ntheir virtue, but did not allow it to embarrass them. They proceeded according to the \nTao, but did not lay any plans. They associated benevolence (with all their doings), but \ndid not rely on it. They pursued righteousness  extensively, \nbut did not try to accumulate it. They responded to ceremonies, but did not conceal (their \nopinion as to the troublesomeness of them). They engaged in affairs as they occurred, \nand did not decline them. They strove to render their laws uniform, but (feared that confusion) \nmight arise from them. They relied upon the people, and did not set light by them. They \ndepended on things as their instruments, and did not discard them. \n\nThey did not think things equal to what they employed them for, but yet they did not see \nthat they could do without employing them. Those who do not understand Heaven are not \npure in their virtue. Those who do not comprehend the Tao have no course which they can \npursue successfully. Alas for them who do not clearly understand the Tao! \n\nWhat is it that we call the Tao? \nThere is the Tao, or Way of Heaven; and there is the Tao, or Way of Man. Doing nothing \nand yet attracting all honour is the Way of Heaven; Doing and being embarrassed thereby \nis the Way of Man. It is the Way of Heaven that plays the part of the Lord; it is the \nWay of Man that plays the part of the Servant. The Way of Heaven and the Way of Man are \nfar apart. They should be clearly distinguished from each other. \n"

    "BOOK XII. THIEN TÎ.": "\n1. Notwithstanding the greatness of heaven and earth, their transforming power proceeds \nfrom one lathe; notwithstanding the number of the myriad things, the government of them \nis one and the same; notwithstanding the multitude of mankind, the lord of them is their \n(one) ruler. The ruler's \n(course) should proceed from the qualities (of the Tao) and be perfected by Heaven, when it is so, it is called 'Mysterious and Sublime.' The ancients ruled the \nworld by doing nothing;—simply by this attribute of Heaven. \n\nIf we look at their words \nin the light of the Tao, (we see that) the appellation for the ruler of the  \nworld was correctly assigned; \nif we look in the same light at the distinctions which they instituted, (we see that) \nthe separation of ruler and ministers was right; if we look at the abilities which they \ncalled forth in the same light, (we see that the duties of) all the offices were well \nperformed; and if we look generally in the same way at all things, (we see that) their \nresponse (to this rule) was complete. Therefore that which pervades (the action of) Heaven and Earth is (this one) \nattribute; that which operates in all things is (this one) course; that by which their \nsuperiors govern the people is the business (of the various departments); and that by \nwhich aptitude is given to ability is skill. The skill was manifested in all the (departments \nof) business; those departments were all administered in righteousness; the righteousness \nwas (the outflow of) the natural virtue; the virtue was manifested according to the Tao; \nand the Tao was according to (the pattern of) Heaven. \n\nHence it is said, 'The \nancients who had the nourishment of the world wished for nothing and the world had enough; \nthey did nothing and all things were transformed; their stillness was abysmal, and the \npeople were all composed.' The Record says, \n'When the one (Tao) pervades it, all business  is completed. \nWhen the mind gets to be free from all aim, even the Spirits submit.' \n\n2. The Master said, 'It \nis the Tao that overspreads and sustains all things. How great It is in Its overflowing \ninfluence! The Superior man ought by all means to remove from his mind (all that is contrary \nto It). Acting without action is what is called Heaven(-like). Speech coming forth of \nitself is what is called (a mark of) the (true) Virtue. Loving men and benefiting things \nis what is called Benevolence. Seeing wherein things that are different yet agree is what \nis called being Great. Conduct free from the ambition of being distinguished above others \nis what is called being Generous. The possession in himself of a myriad points of difference \nis what is called being Rich. Therefore to hold fast the natural attributes is what is \ncalled the Guiding Line (of government); \nthe perfecting of those attributes is what is called its Establishment; accordance with \nthe Tao is what is called being Complete; and not allowing anything external to affect \nthe will is what is called being Perfect. When the Superior man understands these ten \nthings, he keeps all matters as it were sheathed in himself, showing the greatness of \nhis mind; and through the outflow of his doings, all things move (and come to him). Being \nsuch, he lets the gold he hid in the hill, and the pearls in the deep; he considers not \n property or money to be any gain; he keeps aloof from riches \nand honours; he rejoices not in long life, and grieves not for early death; he does not \naccount prosperity a glory, nor is ashamed of indigence; he would not grasp at the gain \nof the whole world to be held as his own private portion; he would not desire to rule \nover the whole world as his own private distinction. His distinction is in understanding \nthat all things belong to the one treasury, and that death and life should be viewed in \nthe same way.' \n\n3. The Master said, 'How still and deep is the place where the Tao resides! How limpid \nis its purity! Metal and stone without It would give forth no sound. They have indeed \nthe (power of) sound (in them), but if they be not struck, they do not emit it. Who can \ndetermine (the qualities that are in) all things? 'The man of kingly qualities holds on \nhis way unoccupied, and is ashamed to busy himself with (the conduct of) affairs. He establishes \nhimself in (what is) the root and source (of his capacity), and his wisdom grows to be \nspirit-like. In this way his attributes become more and more great, and when his mind \ngoes forth, whatever things come in his way, it lays hold of them (and deals with them). \nThus, if there were not the Tao, the bodily form would not have life, and its life, without \nthe attributes (of the Tao), would not be manifested. Is not he who preserves the body \nand gives the fullest development to the life, who establishes the attributes  \nof the Tao and clearly displays It, possessed of kingly qualities? How majestic is he \nin his sudden issuings forth, and in his unexpected movements, when all things follow \nhim!—This we call the man whose qualities fit him to rule. \n\n'He sees where there is the deepest obscurity; he hears where there is no sound. In the \nmidst of the deepest obscurity, he alone sees and can distinguish (various objects); in \nthe midst of a soundless (abyss), he alone can hear a harmony (of notes). Therefore where \none deep is succeeded by a greater, he can people all with things; where one mysterious \nrange is followed by another that is more so, he can lay hold of the subtlest character \nof each. In this way in his intercourse with all things, while he is farthest from having \nanything, he can yet give to them what they seek; while he is always hurrying forth, he \nyet returns to his resting-place; now large, now small; now long, now short; now distant, \nnow near.' \n\n4. Hwang-Ti, enjoying himself on the north of the Red-water, ascended to the height of \nthe Khwan-lun (mountain), and having looked towards the south, was returning home, when \nhe lost his dark-coloured pearl. \nHe employed Wisdom to search for it, but he could not find it. He employed (the clear-sighted) \nLi Ku to search for it, but he  could not find it. He employed \n(the vehement debater) Khieh Khau \nto search for it, but he could not find it. He then employed Purposeless, \nwho found it; on which Hwang-Ti said, 'How strange that it was Purposeless who was able \nto find it!' \n\n5. The teacher of Yao was Hsu Yu; \nof Hsu Yu, Nieh Khueh[2]; of Nieh Khueh, Wang I; \nof Wang I, Phei-i. Yao asked Hsu Yu, saying, \n'Is Nieh Khueh fit to be the correlate of Heaven? \n(If you think he is), I will avail myself of the services of Wang I to constrain him (to \ntake my place).' Hsu Yu replied, 'Such a measure would be hazardous, and full of peril \nto the kingdom! The character of Nieh Khueh is this;—he is acute, perspicacious, \nshrewd and knowing, ready in reply, sharp in retort, and hasty; his natural (endowments) \nsurpass those of other men, but by his human qualities he seeks to obtain the Heavenly \ngift; he exercises his discrimination in suppressing his errors, but he does not know \nwhat is the source from which his errors arise. Make him the correlate of Heaven! He would \nemploy the human qualities, so that no regard would be paid to the Heavenly gift. Moreover, \nhe would assign different functions to the different parts of the one person. \n Moreover, honour would be given to knowledge, and he would have \nhis plans take effect with the speed of fire. Moreover, he would be the slave of everything \nhe initiated. Moreover, he would be embarrassed by things. Moreover, he would be looking \nall round for the response of things (to his measures). Moreover, he would be responding \nto the opinion of the multitude as to what was right. Moreover, he would be changing as \nthings changed, and would not begin to have any principle of constancy. How can such a \nman be fit to be the correlate of Heaven? Nevertheless, as there are the smaller branches \nof a family and the common ancestor of all its branches, he might be the father of a branch, \nbut not the father of the fathers of all the branches. \nSuch government (as he would conduct) would lead to disorder. It would be calamity in \none in the position of a minister, and ruin if he were in the position of the sovereign.' \n\n6. Yao was looking about him at Hwa, \nthe border-warden of which said, 'Ha! the sage! Let me ask blessings on the sage! May \nhe live long!'  Yao said, 'Hush!' but the other went on, 'May \nthe sage become rich!' Yao (again) said, 'Hush!' but (the warden) continued, 'May the \nsage have many sons!' When Yao repeated his 'Hush,' the warden said, 'Long life, riches, \nand many sons are what men wish for;—how is it that you alone do not wish for them?' \nYao replied, 'Many sons bring many fears; riches bring many troubles; and long life gives \nrise to many obloquies. These three things do not help to nourish virtue; and therefore \nI wish to decline them.' The warden rejoined, 'At first I considered you to be a sage; \nnow I see in you only a Superior man. Heaven, in producing the myriads of the people, \nis sure to have appointed for them their several offices. If you had many sons, and gave \nthem (all their) offices, what would you have to fear? If you had riches, and made other \nmen share them with you, what trouble would you have? The sage finds his dwelling like \nthe quail (without any choice of its own), and is fed like the fledgling; he is like the \nbird which passes on (through the air), and leaves no trace (of its flight). When good \norder prevails in the world, he shares in the general prosperity. When there is no such \norder, he cultivates his virtue, and seeks to be unoccupied. After a thousand years, tired \nof the world, he leaves it, and ascends among the immortals. He mounts on the white clouds, \nand arrives at the place of God. The three forms of evil do not reach him, his person \nis always free from misfortune;—what obloquy has he to incur?' \n\nWith this the border-warden left him. Yao followed him, saying, 'I beg to ask—;' \nbut the other said, 'Begone!' \n\n7. When Yao was ruling the world, Po-khang Dze-kao \nwas appointed by him prince of one of the states. From Yao (afterwards) the throne passed \nto Shun, and from Shun (again) to Yu; and (then) Po-khang Dze-kao resigned his principality \nand began to cultivate the ground. Yu went to see him, and found him ploughing in the \nopen country. Hurrying to him, and bowing low in acknowledgment of his superiority, Yu \nthen stood up, and asked him, saying,' Formerly, when Yao was ruling the world, you, Sir, \nwere appointed prince of a state. He gave his sovereignty to Shun, and Shun gave his to \nme, when you, Sir, resigned your dignity, and are (now) ploughing (here);—I venture \nto ask the reason of your conduct.' Dze-kao said, 'When Yao ruled the world, the people \nstimulated one another (to what was right) without his offering them rewards, and stood \nin awe (of doing wrong) without his threatening them with punishments. Now you employ \nboth rewards and punishments, and the people notwithstanding are not good. Their virtue \nwill from this time decay; punishments will from this time prevail; the disorder of future \nages will from this time begin. Why do you, my master, not go away, and not interrupt \nmy work?' With this he resumed his ploughing with his head bent down, and did not (again) \nlook round. \n\n8. In the Grand Beginning (of all things) there was nothing in all the vacancy of space; \nthere was nothing that could be named. \nIt was in this state  that there arose the first existence;—the \nfirst existence, but still without bodily shape. From this things could then be produced, \n(receiving) what we call their proper character. \nThat which had no bodily shape was divided; \nand then without intermission there was what we call the process of conferring. \n(The two processes) continuing in operation, things were produced. As things were completed, \nthere were produced the distinguishing lines of each, which we call the bodily shape. \nThat shape was the body preserving in it the spirit, \nand each had its peculiar manifestation, which we call its Nature. When the Nature has \nbeen cultivated, it returns to its proper character; and when that has been fully reached, \nthere is the same condition as at the Beginning. That sameness is pure vacancy, and the \nvacancy is great. It is like the closing of the beak and silencing the singing (of a bird). \nThat closing and silencing is like the union of heaven and earth (at the beginning). \nThe union, effected, as it  is, might seem to indicate stupidity \nor darkness, but it is what we call the 'mysterious quality' (existing at the beginning); \nit is the same as the Grand Submission (to the Natural Course). \n\n9. The Master asked Lao \nTan, saying, 'Some men regulate the Tao (as by a law), which they have only to follow;—(a \nthing, they say,) is admissible or it is inadmissible; it is so, or it is not so. (They \nare like) the sophists who say that they can distinguish what is hard and what is white \nas clearly as if the objects were houses suspended in the sky. Can such men be said to \nbe sages?' The reply \nwas, 'They are like the busy underlings of a court, who toil their bodies and distress \ntheir minds with their various artifices;—dogs, (employed) to their sorrow to catch \nthe yak, or monkeys that \nare brought from their forests (for their tricksiness). Khiu, I tell you this;—it \nis what you cannot hear, and what you cannot speak of:—Of those who have their heads \nand feet, and yet have neither minds nor ears, there are multitudes; while of those who \nhave their bodies, and at the same time preserve that which has no bodily form or shape, \nthere are really none. It is not in their movements or stoppages, their dying or living, \ntheir falling and rising again, that this is to be found. The regulation of the course \nlies in (their dealing with) the human element in them. When they have forgotten external \nthings,  and have also forgotten the heavenly element in them, \nthey may be named men who have forgotten themselves. The man who has forgotten himself \nis he of whom it is said that he has become identified with Heaven.' \n\n10. At an interview with Ki Khêh, \nKiang-lu Mien said to him, 'Our ruler of Lu \nasked to receive my instructions. I declined, on the ground that I had not received any \nmessage for him. Afterwards, \nhowever, I told him (my thoughts). I do not know whether (what I said) was right or not, \nand I beg to repeat it to you. I said to him, \"You must strive to be courteous and to \nexercise self-restraint; you must distinguish the public-spirited and loyal, and repress \nthe cringing and selfish;—who among the people will in that case dare not to be \nin harmony with you?\"' Ki Khêh laughed quietly and said, 'Your words, my master, as a \ndescription of the right course for a Ti or King, were like the threatening movement of \nits arms by a mantis which would thereby stop the advance of a carriage;—inadequate \nto accomplish your object. And moreover, if he guided himself by your directions, it would \nbe as if he were to increase the dangerous height of his towers  \nand add to the number of his valuables collected in them;—the multitudes (of the \npeople) would leave their (old) ways, and bend their steps in the same direction.' \n\nKiang-lu Mien was awe-struck, and said in his fright, 'I am startled by your words, Master, \nnevertheless, I should like to hear you describe the influence (which a ruler should exert).' \nThe other said, 'If a great sage ruled the kingdom, he would stimulate the minds of the \npeople, and cause them to carry out his instructions fully, and change their manners; \nhe would take their minds which had become evil and violent and extinguish them, carrying \nthem all forward to act in accordance with the (good) will belonging to them as individuals, \nas if they did it of themselves from their nature, while they knew not what it was that \nmade them do so. Would such an one be willing to look up to Yao and Shun in their instruction \nof the people as his elder brothers? He would treat them as his juniors, belonging himself \nto the period of the original plastic ether. \nHis wish would be that all should agree with the virtue (of that early period), and quietly \nrest in it.' \n\n11. Dze-kung had been rambling in the south in Khu, and was returning to Zin. As he passed \n(a place) on the north of the Han, he saw an old man who was going to work on his vegetable \ngarden. He had dug his channels, gone to the well, and was bringing from it in his arms \na jar of water to pour into them. Toiling away, he expended a great deal  \nof strength, but the result which he accomplished was very small. Dze-kung said to him, \n'There is a contrivance here, by means of which a hundred plots of ground may be irrigated \nin one day. With the expenditure of a very little strength, the result accomplished is \ngreat. Would you, Master, not like (to try it)?' The gardener looked up at him, and said, \n'How does it work?' Dze-kung said, 'It is a lever made of wood, heavy behind, and light \nin front. It raises the water as quickly as you could do with your hand, or as it bubbles \nover from a boiler. Its name is a shadoof.' The gardener put on an angry look, laughed, \nand said, 'I have heard from my teacher that, where there are ingenious contrivances, \nthere are sure to be subtle doings; and that, where there are subtle doings, there is \nsure to be a scheming mind. But, when there is a scheming mind in the breast, its pure \nsimplicity is impaired. When this pure simplicity is impaired, the spirit becomes unsettled, \nand the unsettled spirit is not the proper residence of the Tao. It is not that I do not \nknow (the contrivance which you mention), but I should be ashamed to use it.' \n\n(At these words) Dze-kung looked blank and ashamed; he hung down his head, and made no \nreply. After an interval, the gardener said to him, 'Who are you, Sir? A disciple of Khung \nKhiu,' was the reply. The other continued, 'Are you not the scholar whose great learning \nmakes you comparable to a sage, who make it your boast that you surpass all others, who \nsing melancholy ditties all by yourself, thus purchasing a famous reputation throughout \nthe kingdom? If you would (only) forget the energy of your spirit, and neglect the care \nof  your body, you might approximate (to the Tao). But while \nyou cannot regulate yourself, what leisure have you to be regulating the world? Go on \nyour way, Sir, and do not interrupt my work.' \n\nSze-kung shrunk back abashed, and turned pale. He was perturbed, and lost his self-possession, \nnor did he recover it, till he had walked a distance of thirty li. His disciples then \nsaid, 'Who was that man? Why, Master, when you saw him, did you change your bearing, and \nbecome pale, so that you have been all day without returning to yourself?' He replied \nto them,' Formerly I thought that there was but one man \nin the world, and did not know that there was this man. I have heard the Master say that \nto seek for the means of conducting his undertakings so that his success in carrying them \nout may be complete, and how by the employment of a little strength great results may \nbe obtained, is the way of the sage. Now (I perceive that) it is not so at all. They who \nhold fast and cleave to the Tao are complete in the qualities belonging to it. complete \nin those qualities, they are complete in their bodies. Complete in their bodies, they \nare complete in their spirits. To be complete in spirit is the way of the sage. (Such \nmen) live in the world in closest union with the people, going along with them, but they \ndo not know where they are going. Vast and complete is their simplicity! Success, gain, \nand ingenious contrivances, and artful cleverness, indicate (in their opinion) a forgetfulness \nof the (proper) mind of man. These men will not go where their mind does not carry them, \nand will do  nothing of which their mind does not approve. Though \nall the world should praise them, they would (only) get what they think should be loftily \ndisregarded; and though all the world should blame them, they would but lose (what they \nthink) fortuitous and not to be received;—the world's blame and praise can do them \nneither benefit nor injury. Such men may be described as possessing all the attributes \n(of the Tao), while I can only be called one of those who are like the waves carried about \nby the wind.' When he returned to Lu, (Dze-kung) reported the interview and conversation \nto Confucius, who said, 'The man makes a pretence of cultivating the arts of the Embryonic \nAge. He knows the first \nthing, but not the sequel to it. He regulates what is internal in himself, but not what \nis external to himself. If he had intelligence enough to be entirely unsophisticated, \nand by doing nothing to seek to return to the normal simplicity, embodying (the instincts \nof) his nature, and keeping his spirit (as it were) in his arms, so enjoying himself in \nthe common ways, you might then indeed be afraid of him! But what should you and I find \nin the arts of the embryonic time, worth our knowing?' \n\n12. Kun Mang, on his \nway to the ocean, met with Yuan Fung on the \nshore of the eastern sea, and  was asked by him where he was \ngoing. 'I am going,' he replied, 'to the ocean;' and the other again asked, 'What for?' \nKun Mang said, 'Such is the nature of the ocean that the waters which flow into it can \nnever fill it, nor those which flow from it exhaust it. I will enjoy myself, rambling \nby it.' Yuan Fung replied, 'Have you no thoughts about mankind? \nI should like to hear from you about sagely government.' Kun Mang said,' Under the government \nof sages, all offices are distributed according to the fitness of their nature; all appointments \nare made according to the ability of the men; whatever is done is after a complete survey \nof all circumstances; actions and words proceed from the inner impulse, and the whole \nworld is transformed. Wherever their hands are pointed and their looks directed, from \nall quarters the people are all sure to come (to do what they desire):—this is what \nis called government by sages.' \n\n'I should like to hear about (the government of) the kindly, virtuous men,' \n(continued Yuan Fung). The reply was, 'Under the government of the virtuous, when quietly \noccupying (their place), they have no thought, and, when they act, they have no anxiety; \nthey do not keep stored (in their minds) what is right and what is wrong, what is good \nand  what is bad. They share their benefits among all within \nthe four seas, and this produces what is called (the state of) satisfaction; they dispense \ntheir gifts to all, and this produces what is called (the state of) rest. (The people) \ngrieve (on their death) like babies who have lost their mothers, and are perplexed like \ntravellers who have lost their way. They have a superabundance of wealth and all necessaries, \nand they know not whence it comes; they have a sufficiency of food and drink, and they \nknow not from whom they get it:—such are the appearances (under the government) \nof the kindly and virtuous.' \n\n'I should like to hear about (the government of) the spirit-like men,' (continued Yuan \nFung once more). \n\nThe reply was, 'Men of the highest spirit-like qualities mount up on the light, and (the \nlimitations of) the body vanish. This we call being bright and ethereal. They carry out \nto the utmost the powers with which they are endowed, and have not a single attribute \nunexhausted. Their joy is that of heaven and earth, and all embarrassments of affairs \nmelt away and disappear; all things return to their proper nature:—and this is what \nis called (the state of) chaotic obscurity.' \n\n13. Man Wu-kwei and Khih-kang \nMan-khi[2] had been looking at the army of king Wu, when the latter said, 'It is because \nhe was not born in the time of the Lord of Yu, \nthat therefore he is involved  in this trouble (of war).' Man \nWu-kwei replied, 'Was it when the kingdom was in good order, that the Lord of Yu governed \nit? or was it after it had become disordered that he governed it?' The other said, 'That \nthe kingdom be in a condition of good order, is what (all) desire, and (in that case) \nwhat necessity would there be to say anything about the Lord of Yu? He had medicine for \nsores; false hair for the bald; and healing for those who were ill:—he was like \nthe filial son carrying in the medicine to cure his kind father, with every sign of distress \nin his countenance. A sage would be ashamed (of such a thing). \n\n'In the age of perfect virtue they attached no value to wisdom, nor employed men of ability. \nSuperiors were (but) as the higher branches of a tree; and the people were like the deer \nof the wild. They were upright and correct, without knowing that to be so was Righteousness; \nthey loved one another, without knowing that to do so was Benevolence; they were honest \nand leal-hearted, without knowing that it was Loyalty; they fulfilled their engagements, \nwithout knowing that to do so was Good Faith; in their simple movements they employed \nthe services of one another, without thinking that they were conferring or receiving any \ngift. Therefore their actions left no trace, and there was no record of their affairs.' \n\n14. The filial son who does not flatter his father,  and the \nloyal minister who does not fawn on his ruler, are the highest examples of a minister \nand a son. When a son assents to all that his father says, and approves of all that his \nfather does, common opinion pronounces him an unworthy son; when a minister assents to \nall that his ruler says, and approves of all that his ruler does, common opinion pronounces \nhim an unworthy minister. Nor does any one reflect that this view is necessarily correct. \nBut when common opinion (itself) affirms anything and men therefore assent to it, or counts \nanything good and men also approve of it, then it is not said that they are mere consenters \nand flatterers;—is common opinion then more authoritative than a father, or more \nto be honoured than a ruler? Tell a man that he is merely following (the opinions) of \nanother, or that he is a flatterer of others, and at once he flushes with anger. And yet \nall his life he is merely following others, and flattering them. His illustrations are \nmade to agree with theirs; his phrases are glossed:—to win the approbation of the \nmultitudes. From first to last, from beginning to end, he finds no fault with their views. \nHe will let his robes hang down, \ndisplay the colours on them, and arrange his movements and bearing, so as to win the favour \nof his age, and yet not call himself a flatterer. He is but a follower of those others, \napproving and disapproving  as they do, and yet he will not say \nthat he is one of them. This is the height of stupidity. \n\nHe who knows his stupidity is not very stupid; he who knows that he is under a delusion \nis not greatly deluded. He who is greatly deluded will never shake the delusion off; he \nwho is very stupid will all his life not become intelligent. If three men be walking together, \nand (only) one of them be under a delusion (as to their way), they may yet reach their \ngoal, the deluded being the fewer; but if two of them be under the delusion, they will \nnot do so, the deluded being the majority. At the present time, when the whole world is \nunder a delusion, though I pray men to go in the right direction, I cannot make them do \nso;—is it not a sad case? \n\nGrand music does not penetrate the ears of villagers; but if they hear 'The Breaking of \nthe Willow,' or 'The Bright Flowers,' \nthey will roar with laughter. So it is that lofty words do not remain in the minds of \nthe multitude, and that perfect words are not heard, because the vulgar words predominate. \nBy two earthenware instruments the (music of) a bell will be confused, and the pleasure \nthat it would afford cannot be obtained. At the present time the whole world is under \na delusion, and though I wish to go in a certain direction, how can I succeed in doing \nso? Knowing that I cannot do so, if I were to try to force my way, that would be another \ndelusion. Therefore my best course is to let my purpose go, and no more pursue it. If \nI do not pursue it, whom shall I have to share in my sorrow? \n\nIf an ugly man have a \nson born to him at midnight, he hastens with a light to look at it. Very eagerly he does \nso, only afraid that it may be like himself. \n\n15. From a tree a hundred \nyears old a portion shall be cut and fashioned into a sacrificial vase, with the bull \nfigured on it, which is ornamented further with green and yellow, while the rest (of that \nportion) is cut away and thrown into a ditch. If now we compare the sacrificial vase with \nwhat was thrown into the ditch, there will be a difference between them as respects their \nbeauty and ugliness; but they both agree in having lost the (proper) nature of the wood. \nSo in respect of their practice of righteousness there is a difference between (the robber) \nKih on the one hand, and Zang (Shan) or Shih (Zhiu) on the other; but they all agree in \nhaving lost (the proper qualities of) their nature. \n\nNow there are five things which produce (in men) the loss of their (proper) nature. The \nfirst is (their fondness for) the five colours which disorder the eye, and take from it \nits (proper) clearness of vision; the second is (their fondness for) the five notes (of \nmusic), which disorder the ear and take from it its  (proper) \npower of hearing; the third is (their fondness for) the five odours which penetrate the \nnostrils, and produce a feeling of distress all over the forehead; the fourth is (their \nfondness for) the five flavours, which deaden the mouth, and pervert its sense of taste; \nthe fifth is their preferences and dislikes, which unsettle the mind, and cause the nature \nto go flying about. These five things are all injurious to the life; and now Yang and \nMo begin to stretch forward from their different standpoints, each thinking that he has \nhit on (the proper course for men). \n\nBut the courses they have hit on are not what I call the proper course. What they have \nhit on (only) leads to distress;—can they have hit on what is the right thing? If \nthey have, we may say that the dove in a cage has found the right thing for it. Moreover, \nthose preferences and dislikes, that (fondness for) music and colours, serve but to pile \nup fuel (in their breasts); while their caps of leather, the bonnet with kingfishers' \nplumes, the memorandum tablets which they carry, and their long girdles, serve but as \nrestraints on their persons. Thus inwardly stuffed full as a hole for fuel, and outwardly \nfast bound with cords, when they look quietly round from out of their bondage, and think \nthey have got all they could desire, they are no better than criminals whose arms are \ntied together, and their fingers subjected to the screw, or than tigers and leopards in \nsacks or cages, and yet thinking that they have got (all they could wish). \n"

    "BOOK XIII. THIEN TÂO.": "\n1. The Way of Heaven operates (unceasingly), and leaves no accumulation (of its influence) \nin any particular place, so that all things are brought to perfection by it; so does the \nWay of the Tîs operate, and all under the sky turn to them (as their directors); so also \ndoes the Way of the Sages operate, and all within the seas submit to them. Those who clearly \nunderstand (the Way of) Heaven, who are in sympathy with (that of) the sages, and familiar \nthrough the universe and in the four quarters (of the earth) with the work of the Tîs \nand the kings, yet act spontaneously from themselves:—with the appearance of being \nignorant they are yet entirely still.\n\nThe stillness of the sages does not belong to them as a consequence of their skilful ability; \nall things are not able to disturb their minds;—it is on this account that they are \nstill. When water is still, its clearness shows the beard and eyebrows (of him\n\nwho looks into it). It is a perfect Level, and the greatest artificer takes his rule \nfrom it. Such is the clearness of still water, and how much greater is that of the human \nSpirit! The still mind of the sage is the mirror of heaven and earth, the glass of all \nthings.\n\nVacancy, stillness, placidity, tastelessness, quietude, silence, and non-action;—this \nis the Level of heaven and earth, and the perfection of the Tâo and its characteristics. \nTherefore the Tîs, Kings, and Sages found in this their resting-place. Resting here, \nthey were vacant; from their vacancy came fullness; from their fullness came the nice \ndistinctions (of things). From their vacancy came stillness; that stillness was followed \nby movement; their movements were successful. From their stillness came their non-action. \nDoing-nothing, they devolved the cares of office on their employés. Doing-nothing was \naccompanied by the feeling of satisfaction. Where there is that feeling of satisfaction, \nanxieties and troubles find no place; and the years of life are many.\n\nVacancy, stillness, placidity, tastelessness, quietude, silence, and doing-nothing are \nthe root of all things. When this is understood, we find such a ruler on the throne as \nYâo, and such a minister as Shun. When with this a high position is occupied, we find \nthe attributes of the Tîs and kings,—the sons of Heaven; with this in a low position, \nwe find the mysterious \n\nsages, the uncrowned kings, with their ways. With this retiring (from public life), and \nenjoying themselves at leisure, we find the scholars who dwell by the rivers and seas, \namong the hills and forests, all submissive to it; with this coming forward to active \nlife and comforting their age, their merit is great, and their fame is distinguished;—and \nall the world becomes united in one.\n\n2. (Such men) by their stillness become sages and by their movement, kings. Doing-nothing, \nthey are honoured; in their plain simplicity, no one in the world can strive with them \n(for the palm of) excellence. The clear understanding of the virtue of Heaven and Earth \nis what is called 'The Great Root,' and 'The Great Origin;'—they who have it are \nin harmony with Heaven, and so they produce all equable arrangements in the world;—they \nare those who are in harmony with men. Being in harmony with men is called the joy of \nmen; being in harmony with Heaven is called the joy of Heaven. Kwang-dze said, 'My Master! \nmy Master! He shall hash and blend all things in mass without being cruel; he shall dispense \nhis favours to all ages without being benevolent. He is older than the highest antiquity, \nand yet is not old. He overspreads the heavens and sustains the earth; from him is the \ncarving of all forms without any artful skill! This is what is called the Joy of Heaven. \nHence it is said, \"Those who know the Joy of Heaven during their life, act like Heaven, \nand at death undergo transformation like (other) things; in their stillness\n\nthey possess the quality of the Yin, and in their movement they flow abroad as the Yang. \nTherefore he who knows the joy of Heaven has no murmuring against Heaven, nor any fault-finding \nwith men; and suffers no embarrassment from things, nor any reproof from ghosts. Hence \nit is said, His movements are those of Heaven; his stillness is that of Earth; his whole \nmind is fixed, and he rules over the world. The spirits of his dead do not come to scare \nhim; he is not worn out by their souls. His words proceeding from his vacancy and stillness, \nyet reach to heaven and earth, and show a communication with all things:—this is \nwhat is called the joy of Heaven. This joy of Heaven forms the mind of the sage whereby \nhe nurtures all under the sky.'\"'\n\n3. It was the Way of the \nTîs and Kings to regard Heaven and Earth as their Author, \nthe Tâo and its characteristics as their Lord, and Doing-nothing as their constant rule. \nDoing-nothing, they could use the whole world in their service and might have done more; \nacting, they were not sufficient for the service required of them by the world. Hence \nthe men of old held non-inaction in honour. When superiors do nothing and their inferiors \nalso do nothing, inferiors and superiors possess the same virtue; and when inferiors and \nsuperiors possess the same virtue, there are none to act as ministers. When inferiors \nact, and their superiors also act, then superiors and inferiors possess the same Tâo; \nand when superiors and inferiors possess the same\n\nTâo, there is none to preside as Lord. But that the superiors do nothing and yet thereby \nuse the world in their service, and that the inferiors, while acting, be employed in the \nservice of the world, is an unchangeable principle. Therefore the ancient kings who presided \nover the world, though their knowledge embraced (all the operations of) Heaven and Earth, \ntook no thought of their own about them; though their nice discrimination appreciated \nthe fine fashioning of all things, they said not a word about it; though their power comprehended \nall within the seas, they did nothing themselves. Heaven produces nothing, yet all things \nexperience their transformations; Earth effects no growth, yet all things receive their \nnurture; the Tîs and Kings did nothing, yet all the world testified their effective services. \nHence it is said, 'There is nothing more spirit-like than Heaven; there is nothing richer \nthan Earth; there are none greater than the Tî s and Kings.' Hence it is said (further), \n'The attributes of the Tîs and kings corresponded to those of Heaven and Earth.' It was \nthus that they availed themselves of (the operations of) Heaven and Earth, carried all \nthings on unceasingly (in their courses), and employed the various classes of men in their \nservice.\n\n4. Originating belongs to those in the higher position; details (of work) to those who \nare in the lower. The compendious decision belongs to the lord; the minutiae of execution, \nto his ministers. The direction of the three hosts and their men with the five weapons is but a trifling quality; rewards\n\nand penalties with their advantages and sufferings, and the inflictions of the five punishments \nare but trivial elements of instruction; ceremonies, laws, measures, and numbers, with \nall the minutiae of jurisprudence, \nare small matters in government; the notes of bells \nand drums, and the display of plumes and flags are the slightest things in music, and \nthe various grades of the mourning garments are the most unimportant manifestations of \ngrief. These five unimportant adjuncts required the operation of the excited spirit and \nthe employment of the arts of the mind, to bring them into use. The men of old had them \nindeed, but they did not give them the first place.\n\nThe ruler precedes, and the minister follows; the father precedes, and the son follows; \nthe elder brother precedes, and the younger follows; the senior precedes, and the junior \nfollows; the male precedes, and the female follows; the husband precedes, and the wife \nfollows.\n\nThis precedence of the more honourable and sequence of the meaner is seen in the (relative) \naction of heaven and earth, and hence the sages took them as their pattern. The more honourable \nposition of heaven and the lower one of earth are equivalent to a designation of their \nspirit-like and intelligent qualities. The precedence of spring and summer and the sequence \nof autumn and winter mark the\n\norder of the four seasons. In the transformations and growth of all things, every bud \nand feature has its proper form; and in this we have their gradual maturing and decay, \nthe constant flow of transformation and change. Thus since Heaven and Earth, which are \nmost spirit-like, are distinguished as more honourable and less, and by precedence and \nsequence, how much more must we look for this in the ways of men! In the ancestral temple \nit is to kinship that honour is given; in court, to rank; in the neighbourhoods and districts, \nto age; in the conduct of affairs, to wisdom; such is the order in those great ways. If \nwe speak of the course (to be pursued in them), and do not observe their order, we violate \ntheir course. If we speak of the course, and do not observe it, why do we apply that name \nto it?\n\n5. Therefore the ancients who clearly understood the great Tâo first sought to apprehend \nwhat was meant by Heaven, \nand the Tâo and its characteristics came next. When this \nwas apprehended, then came Benevolence and Righteousness. When these were apprehended, \nthen came the Distinction of duties and the observance of them. This accomplished, there \ncame objects and their names. After objects and their names, came the employment of men \naccording to their qualities: on this there followed the examination of the men and of \ntheir work. This led to the approval or disapproval of them, which again was succeeded \nby the apportioning of rewards and penalties. After this the stupid and the intelligent \nunderstood what was required of them, and the honourable and the mean occupied their several \npositions.\n\nThe good and the able, and those inferior to them, sincerely did their best. Their ability \nwas distributed; the duties implied in their official names were fulfilled. In this way \ndid they serve their superiors, nourish their inferiors, regulate things, and cultivate \ntheir persons. They did not call their knowledge and schemes into requisition; they were \nrequired to fall back upon (the method of) Heaven:—this was what is called the Perfection \nof the Rule of Great Peace. Hence it is said in the Book, 'There are objects and there \nare their names.' Objects and their names the ancients had; but they did not put them \nin the foremost place.\n\nWhen the ancients spoke of the Great Tâo, it was only after four other steps that they \ngave a place to 'Objects and their Names,' and after eight steps that they gave a place \nto 'Rewards and Penalties.' If they had all at once spoken of 'Objects and their Names,' \nthey would have shown an ignorance of what is the Root (of government); if they had all \nat once spoken of 'Rewards and Penalties,' they would have shown an ignorance of the first \nsteps of it. Those whose words are thus an inversion of the (proper) course, or in opposition \nto it, are (only fit to be) ruled by others;-how can they rule others? To speak all at \nonce of 'Objects and their Names,' and of 'Rewards and Penalties,' only shows that the \nspeaker knows the instruments of government, but does not know the method of it, is fit \nto be used as an instrument in the world, but not fit to use others as his instruments:—he \nis what we call a mere sophist, a man of one small idea.\n\nCeremonies, laws, numbers, measures, with all the minutiae of jurisprudence, the ancients \nhad; but it is by these that inferiors serve their superiors; it is not by them that those \nsuperiors nourish the world.\n\n6. Anciently, Shun asked Yâo, saying, 'In what way does your Majesty by the Grace of Heaven \nexercise your mind?' The reply was, 'I simply show no arrogance towards the helpless; \nI do not neglect the poor people; I grieve for those who die; I love their infant children; \nand I compassionate their widows.' Shun rejoined, 'Admirable, as far as it goes; but it \nis not what is Great.' How then,' asked Yâo, 'do you think I should do?' Shun replied, \n'When (a sovereign) possesses the virtue of Heaven, then when he shows himself in action, \nit is in stillness. The sun and moon (simply) shine, and the four seasons pursue their \ncourses. So it is with the regular phenomena of day and night, and with the movement of \nthe clouds by which the rain is distributed.' Yâo said, 'Then I have only been persistently \ntroubling myself! What you wish is to be in harmony with Heaven, while I wish to be in \nharmony with men.' Now (the Way of) Heaven and Earth was much thought of of old, and Hwang-Tî, \nYâo, and Shun united in admiring it. Hence the kings of the world of old did nothing, \nbut tried to imitate that Way.\n\n7. Confucius went to the west to deposit (some) writings in the library of Kâu, when Dze-lû counselled\n\nhim, saying, 'I have heard that the officer in charge of this Käng Repository of Kâu \nwas one Lâo Tan, who has given up his office, and is living in his own house. As you, \nMaster, wish to deposit these writings here, why not go to him, and obtain his help (to \naccomplish your object).' \nConfucius said, 'Good;' and he went and saw Lâo Tan, who \nrefused his assistance. On this he proceeded to give an abstract of the Twelve Classics \nto bring the other over to his views. \nLâo Tan, however, interrupted him while he was \nspeaking, and said, 'This is too vague; let me hear the substance of them in brief'. Confucius \nsaid, 'The substance of them is occupied with Benevolence and Righteousness.' The other \nsaid, 'Let me ask whether you consider Benevolence and Righteousness to constitute the \nnature of man?' 'I do,' was the answer. 'If the superior man be not benevolent, he will \nnot fulfil his character; if he be not righteous, he might as well not have been born. \nBenevolence and Righteousness are truly the nature of man.' Lâo Tan continued, 'Let me \nask you what you mean by Benevolence and Righteousness.' Confucius said, 'To be in one's \ninmost heart in kindly sympathy\n\nwith all things; to love all men; and to allow no selfish thoughts;—this is the nature \nof Benevolence and Righteousness.' Lâo Tan exclaimed, 'Ah! you almost show your inferiority \nby such words! \"To love all men!\" is not that vague and extravagant? \"To be seeking to \nallow no selfish thoughts!\"—that is selfishness! If you, Master, wish men not \nto be without their (proper) shepherding, think of Heaven and Earth, which certainly pursue \ntheir invariable course; think of the sun and moon, which surely maintain their brightness; \nthink of the stars in the zodiac, which preserve their order and courses; think of birds \nand beasts, which do not fail to collect together in their flocks and herds; and think \nof the trees, which do not fail to stand up (in their places). Do you, Master, imitate \nthis way and carry it into practice; hurry on, following this course, and you will reach \nyour end. Why must you further be vehement in putting forward your Benevolence and Righteousness, \nas if you were beating a drum, and seeking a fugitive son, (only making him run away the \nmore)? Ah! Master, you are introducing disorder into the nature of man!'\n\n8. Shih-khäng Khî, \nhaving an interview with Lâo-dze, asked him, saying, 'I heard, Master, \nthat you were a sage, and I came here, wishing to see you, without grudging the length \nof the journey. During the stages of the hundred days, the soles of my feet became quite \ncallous, but I did not dare to stop and rest. Now I perceive that you are not\n\na sage. Because there was some rice left about the holes of the rats, you sent away your \nyounger sister, which was unkind; when your food, whether raw or cooked, remains before \nyou not all consumed, you keep on hoarding it up to any extent.' Lâo-dze looked indifferent, \nand gave him no answer.\n\nNext day Khî again saw Lao-dze, and said, 'Yesterday I taunted you; but to-day I have \ngone back to a better mood of mind. What is the cause (of the change)?' Lâo-dze replied, \n'I consider that I have freed myself from the trammels of claiming to be artfully knowing, \nspirit-like, and sage. Yesterday if you had called me an ox, you might have done so; or \nif you had called me a horse, you might have done so. If there be a reality (corresponding \nto men's ideas), and men give it a name, which another will not receive, he will in the \nsequel suffer the more. My manner was what I constantly observe;—I did not put it \non for the occasion.'\n\nShih-khäng Khî sidled away out of Lâo's shadow; then he retraced his steps, advanced forward, \nand asked how he should cultivate himself. The reply was, 'Your demeanour is repelling; \nyou stare with your eyes; your forehead is broad and yet tapering; you bark and growl \nwith your mouth; your appearance is severe and pretentious; you are like a horse held \nby its tether, you would move, but are restrained, and (if let go) would start off like \nan\n\narrow from a bow; you examine all the minutiae of a thing; your wisdom is artful, and \nyet you try to look at ease. All these are to be considered proofs of your want of sincerity. \nIf on the borders one were to be found with them, he would be named a Thief.'\n\n9. The Master said, \n'The Tâo does not exhaust itself in what is greatest, nor is it \never absent from what is least; and therefore it is to be found complete and diffused \nin all things. How wide is its universal comprehension! How deep is its unfathomableness! \nThe embodiment of its attributes in benevolence and righteousness is but a small result \nof its spirit-like (working); but it is only the perfect man who can determine this. The \nperfect man has (the charge of) the world;—is not the charge great? and yet it is \nnot sufficient to embarrass him. He wields the handle of power over the whole world, and \nyet it is nothing to him. His discrimination detects everything false, and no consideration \nof gain moves him. He penetrates to the truth of things, and can guard that which is fundamental. \nSo it is that heaven and earth are external to him, and he views all things with indifference, \nand his spirit is never straitened by them. He has comprehended the Tho, and is in harmony \nwith its characteristics; he pushes back benevolence and righteousness (into their proper \nplace), and deals with ceremonies and music as (simply) guests:—yes, the mind of \nthe perfect man determines all things aright.'\n\n10. What the world thinks the most valuable exhibition of the Tâo is to be found in books. \nBut books are only a collection of words. Words have what is valuable in them;—what \nis valuable in words is the ideas they convey. But those ideas are a sequence of something \nelse;—and what that something else is cannot be conveyed by words. When the world, \nbecause of the value which it attaches to words, commits them to books, that for which \nit so values them may not deserve to be valued;—because that which it values is not \nwhat is really valuable.\n\nThus it is that what we look at and can see is (only) the outward form and colour, and \nwhat we listen to and can hear is (only) names and sounds. Alas! that men of the world \nshould think that form and colour, name and sound, should be sufficient to give them the \nreal nature of the Tâo. The form and colour, the name and sound, are certainly not sufficient \nto convey its real nature; and so it is that 'the wise do not speak and those who do speak \nare not wise.' How should the world know that real nature?\n\nDuke Hwan, seated above \nin his hall, was (once) reading a book, and the wheelwright \nPhien was making a wheel below it. \nLaying aside his hammer and chisel, Phien went up \nthe steps, and said, 'I venture to ask your Grace what words you are reading?' The duke \nsaid, 'The words of the sages.' 'Are those sages alive?' Phien continued.\n'They are dead,' was the reply. 'Then,' said the other, 'what you, my Ruler, are reading \nare only the dregs and sediments of those old men.' The duke said, 'How should you, a \nwheelwright, have anything to say about the book which I am reading? If you can explain \nyourself, very well; if you cannot, you shall die!' The wheelwright said, 'Your servant \nwill look at the thing from the point of view of his own art. In making a wheel, if I \nproceed gently, that is pleasant enough, but the workmanship is not strong; if I proceed \nviolently, that is toilsome and the joinings do not fit. If the movements of my hand are \nneither (too) gentle nor (too) violent, the idea in my mind is realised. But I cannot \ntell (how to do this) by word of mouth; there is a knack in it. I cannot teach the knack \nto my son, nor can my son learn it from me. Thus it is that I am in my seventieth year, \nand am (still) making wheels in my old age. But these ancients, and what it was not \npossible for them to Convey, are dead and gone:—so then what you, my Ruler, are reading \nis but their dregs and sediments!'\n"

    "BOOK XIV. THIEN YÜN.": "\n1. How (ceaselessly) heaven revolves! Flow (constantly) earth abides at rest! And do the \nsun and moon contend about their (respective) places? Who presides over and directs these \n(things)? Who binds and connects them together? Who is it that, without trouble or exertion \non his part, causes and maintains them? Is it, perhaps, that there is some secret spring, \nin consequence of which they cannot be but as they are? Or is it, perhaps, that they move \nand turn as they do, and cannot stop of themselves?\n\n(Then) how the clouds become rain! And how the rain again forms the clouds! Who diffuses \nthem so abundantly? Who is it that, without trouble or exertion on his part, produces \nthis elemental enjoyment, and seems to stimulate it?\n\nThe winds rise in the north; one blows to the west, and another to the east; while some \nrise upwards, uncertain in their direction. By whose breathing are they produced? Who \nis it that, without any trouble and exertion of his own, effects all their undulations? \nI venture to ask their cause.\n\nWû-hsien Thiâo said, 'Come, \nand I will tell you. To heaven there belong the six Extreme \nPoints, and the five Elements. \nWhen the Tîs and Kings acted in accordance with them, \nthere was good government; when they acted contrary to them, there was evil. Observing \nthe things (described) in the nine divisions (of the writing) of Lo, their government \nwas perfected and their virtue was complete. They inspected and enlightened the kingdom \nbeneath them, and all under the sky acknowledged and sustained them. Such was the condition \nunder the august (sovereigns) \nand those before them.'\n\n2. Tang, the chief \nadministrator of Shang, \nasked Kwang-dze about Benevolence, \nand the answer was, 'Wolves and tigers are benevolent.' 'What do you mean?' said Tang. \nKwang-dze replied, 'Father and son (among them) are affectionate to one another. Why should \nthey be considered as not benevolent?'\n'Allow me to ask about perfect benevolence,' pursued the other. Kwang-dze said, 'Perfect \nbenevolence does not \nadmit (the feeling) of affection.' The minister said, 'I have \nheard that, without (the feeling of) affection there is no love, and without love there \nis not filial duty;—is it permissible to say that the perfectly benevolent are not \nfilial?' Kwang-dze rejoined, 'That is not the way to put the case. Perfect Benevolence \nis the very highest thing;—filial duty is by no means sufficient to describe it. \nThe saying which you quote is not to the effect that (such benevolence) transcends filial \nduty;—it does not refer to such duty at all. One, travelling to the south, comes \n(at last) to Ying, \nand there, standing with his face to the north, he does not see \nmount Ming. \nWhy does he not see it? Because he is so far from it. Hence it is said, \n\"Filial duty as a part of reverence is easy, but filial duty as a part of love is difficult. \nIf it be easy as a part of love, yet it is difficult to forget one's parents. It may \nbe easy for me to forget my parents, but it is difficult to make my parents forget me. \nIf it were easy to make my parents forget me, it is difficult for me to forget all men \nin the world. If it were easy to forget all men in the world, it is difficult to make \nthem all forget me.\"\n\n'This virtue might make one think light of Yâo and Shun, and not wish to be they. The profit\n\nand beneficial influences of it extend to a myriad ages, and no one in the world knows \nwhence they come. How can you simply heave a great sigh, and speak (as you do) of benevolence \nand filial duty? Filial duty, fraternal respect, benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, \nsincerity, firmness, and purity;—all these may be pressed into the service of this \nvirtue, but they are far from sufficient to come up to it. Therefore it is said, \"To him \nwho has what is most noble, \nall the dignities of a state are as nothing; to him \nwho has what is the greatest riches, all the wealth of a state is as nothing; to him who \nhas all that he could wish, fame and praise are as nothing.\" It is thus that the Tâo admits \nof no substitute.'\n\n3. Pei-män Khäng asked \nHwang-Tî, saying, 'You were celebrating, O Tî, a performance \nof the music of the Hsien-khih, \nin the open country near the Thung-thing lake. When \nI heard the first part of it, I was afraid; the next made me weary; and the last perplexed \nme. I became agitated and unable to speak, and lost my self-possession.' The Tî said, \n'It was likely that it should so affect you! It was performed with (the instruments of) \nmen, and all attuned according to (the influences of) Heaven. It\n\nproceeded according to (the principles of) propriety and righteousness, and was pervaded \nby (the idea of) the Grand Purity.\n\n'The Perfect Music first had its response in the affairs of men, and was conformed to \nthe principles of Heaven; it indicated the action of the five virtues, and corresponded \nto the spontaneity (apparent in nature). After this it showed the blended distinctions \nof the four seasons, and the grand harmony of all things;—the succession of those \nseasons one after another, and the production of things in their proper order. Now it \nswelled, and now it died away, its peaceful and military strains clearly distinguished \nand given forth. Now it was clear, and now rough, as if the contracting and expanding \nof the elemental processes blended harmoniously (in its notes). Those notes then flowed \naway in waves of light, till, as when the hibernating insects first begin to move, I commanded \nthe terrifying crash of thunder. Its end was marked by no formal conclusion, and it began \nagain without any prelude. It seemed to die away, and then it burst into life; it came \nto a close, and then it rose again. So it went on regularly and inexhaustibly, and without \nthe intervention of any pause:—it was this which made you afraid.\n\n'In the second part (of the performance), I made it describe the harmony of the Yin and \nYang, and threw round it the brilliance of the sun and moon. Its notes were now short \nand now long, now soft and now hard. Their changes, however, were marked by an unbroken \nunity, though not dominated by a fixed regularity. They filled every valley and ravine; \nyou might shut up every crevice, and guard your spirit (against their entrance), yet\n\nthere was nothing but gave admission to them. Yea, those notes resounded slowly, and might \nhave been pronounced high and clear. Hence the shades of the dead kept in their obscurity; \nthe sun and moon, and all the stars of the zodiac, pursued their several courses. I made \n(my instruments) leave off, when (the performance) came to an end, and their (echoes) \nflowed on without stopping. You thought anxiously about it, and were not able to understand \nit; you looked for it, and were not able to see it; you pursued it, and were not able \nto reach it. All amazed, you stood in the way all open around you, and then you leant \nagainst an old rotten dryandra tree and hummed. The power of your eyes was exhausted by \nwhat you wished to see; your strength failed in your desire to pursue it, while I myself \ncould not reach it. Your body was but so much empty vacancy while you endeavoured to retain \nyour self-possession:—it \nwas that endeavour which made you weary.\n\n'In the last part (of the performance), I employed notes which did not have that wearying \neffect. I blended them together as at the command of spontaneity. Hence they came as if \nfollowing one another in confusion, like a clump of plants springing from one root, or \nlike the music of a forest produced by no visible form. They spread themselves all around \nwithout leaving a trace (of their cause); and seemed to issue from deep obscurity where \nthere was no sound. Their movements came from nowhere; their home was in the deep darkness;—\n\nconditions which some would call death, and some life; some, the fruit, and some, (merely) \nthe flower. Those notes, moving and flowing on, separating and shifting, and not following \nany regular sounds, the world might well have doubts about them, and refer them to the \njudgment of a sage, for the sages understand the nature of this music, and judge in accordance \nwith the prescribed (spontaneity). While the spring of that spontaneity has not been touched, \nand yet the regulators of the five notes are all prepared;—this is what is called \nthe music of Heaven, delighting the mind without the use of words. Hence it is said in \nthe eulogy of the Lord of Piâo, \n\"You listen for it, and do not hear its sound; you \nlook for it, and do not perceive its form; it fills heaven and earth; it envelopes all \nwithin the universe.\" You wished to hear it, but could not take it in; and therefore you \nwere perplexed.\n\n'I performed first the music calculated to awe; and you were frightened as if by a ghostly \nvisitation, I followed it with that calculated to weary; and in your weariness you would \nhave withdrawn. I concluded with that calculated to perplex; and in your perplexity you \nfelt your stupidity. But that stupidity is akin to the Tâo; you may with it convey the \nTâo in your person, and have it (ever) with you.'\n\n4. When Confucius was travelling in the west in Wei, Yen Yüan asked the music-master Kin, \nsaying,\n\n'How is it, do you think, with the course of the Master?' The music-master replied, 'Alas! \nit is all over with your Master!' 'How so?' asked Yen Yüan; and the other said, 'Before \nthe grass-dogs \nare set forth (at the sacrifice), they are deposited in a box or basket, \nand wrapt up with elegantly embroidered cloths, while the representative of the dead and \nthe officer of prayer prepare themselves by fasting to present them. After they have been \nset forth, however, passers-by trample on their heads and backs, and the grass-cutters \ntake and burn them in cooking. That is all they are good for. If one should again take \nthem, replace them in the box or basket, wrap them up with embroidered cloths, and then \nin rambling, or abiding at the spot, should go to sleep under them, if he do not get (evil) \ndreams, he is sure to be often troubled with the nightmare. Now here is your Master in \nthe same way taking the grass-dogs, presented by the ancient kings, and leading his disciples \nto wander or abide and sleep under them. Owing to this, the tree (beneath which they were \npractising ceremonies) in Sung was cut down; he was obliged to leave Wei; he was \nreduced to extremities in Shang and Kâu:—were not those experiences like having \n(evil) dreams? He was kept in a state of siege between Khän and Zhâi, so that for seven \ndays he had no cooked food to eat, and was in a situation between life and death:—were \nnot those experiences like the nightmare?\n\n'If you are travelling by water, your best plan is to use a boat; if by land, a carriage. \nTake a boat, which will go (easily) along on the water, and try to push it along on the \nland, and all your lifetime it will not go so much as a fathom or two:—are not ancient \ntime and the present time like the water and the dry land? and are not Kâu and Lû like \nthe boat and the carriage? To seek now to practise (the old ways of) Kâu in Lû is like \npushing along a boat on the dry land. It is only a toilsome labour, and has no success; \nhe who does so is sure to meet with calamity. He has not learned that in handing down \nthe arts (of one time) he is sure to be reduced to extremity in endeavouring to adapt \nthem to the conditions (of another).\n\n'And have you not seen the working of a shadoof? When (the rope of) it is pulled, it bends \ndown; and when it is let go, it rises up. It is pulled by a man, and does not pull the \nman; and so, whether it bends down or rises up, it commits no offence against the man. \nIn the same way the rules of propriety, righteousness, laws, and measures of the three \nHwangs and five Tîs derived their excellence, not from their being the same as those \nof the present day, but from their (aptitude for) government. We may compare them to haws, \npears, oranges,\n\nand pummeloes, which are different in flavour, but all suitable to be eaten. Just so it \nis that the rules of propriety, righteousness, laws, and measures, change according to \nthe time.\n\n'If now you take a monkey, and dress it in the robes of the duke of Kâu, it will bite \nand tear them, and will not be satisfied till it has got rid of them altogether. And if \nyou look at the difference between antiquity and the present time it is as great as that \nbetween the monkey and the duke of Kâu. In the same way, when Hsî Shih was troubled \nin mind, she would knit her brows and frown on all in her neighbourhood. An ugly woman \nof the neighbourhood, seeing and admiring her beauty, went home, and also laying her hands \non her heart proceeded to stare and frown on all around her. When the rich people of the \nvillage saw her, they shut fast their doors and would not go out; when the poor people \nsaw her, they took their wives and children and ran away from her. The woman knew how \nto admire the frowning beauty, but she did not know how it was that she, though frowning, \nwas beautiful. Alas! it is indeed all over with your Master!'\n\n5. When Confucius was in his fifty-first year, he had not heard of the Tâo, and went \nsouth to Phei\nto see Lâo Tan, who said to him, 'You have come, Sir; have you? I have heard that you \nare the wisest man of the North; have you also got the Tâo?' 'Not yet,' was the reply; \nand the other went on, 'How have you sought it?' Confucius said, 'I sought it in measures \nand numbers, and after five years I had not got it.' 'And how then did you seek it?' 'I \nsought it in the Yin and Yang, and after twelve years I have not found it.' Lâo-dze said, \n'Just so! If the Tâo could be presented (to another), men would all present it to their \nrulers; if it could be served up (to others), men would all serve it up to their parents; \nif it could be told (to others), men would all tell it to their brothers; if it could \nbe given to others, men would all give it to their sons and grandsons. The reason why \nit cannot be transmitted is no other but this,—that if, within, there be not the \npresiding principle, it will not remain there, and if, outwardly, there be not the correct \nobedience, it will not be carried out. When that which is given out from the mind (in \npossession of it) is not received by the mind without, the sage will not give it out; \nand when, entering in from without, there is no power in the receiving mind to entertain \nit, the sage will not permit it to lie hid there. Fame is a possession common to all; \nwe should not seek to have much of it. Benevolence and righteousness were as the lodging-houses \nof the former kings; we should only rest in them for a night, and not occupy them for\n\nlong. If men see us doing so, they will have much to say against us.\n\n'The perfect men of old trod the path of benevolence as a path which they borrowed for \nthe occasion, and dwelt in Righteousness as in a lodging which they used for a night. \nThus they rambled in the vacancy of Untroubled Ease, found their food in the fields of \nIndifference, and stood in the gardens which they had not borrowed. Untroubled Ease requires \nthe doing of nothing; Indifference is easily supplied with nourishment; not borrowing \nneeds no outlay. The ancients called this the Enjoyment that Collects the True.\n\n'Those who think that wealth is the proper thing for them cannot give up their revenues; \nthose who seek distinction cannot give up the thought of fame; those who cleave to power \ncannot give the handle of it to others. While they hold their grasp of those things, they \nare afraid (of losing them). When they let them go, they are grieved; and they will not \nlook at a single example, from which they might perceive the (folly) of their restless \npursuits:-such men are under the doom of Heaven.\n\n'Hatred and kindness; taking and giving; reproof and instruction; death and life:—these \neight things are instruments of rectification, but only those are able to use them who \ndo not obstinately refuse to comply with their great changes. Hence it is said, \"Correction \nis Rectification.\" When the minds of\n\nsome do not acknowledge this, it is because the gate of Heaven (in them) has not been \nopened.'\n\n6. At an interview with Lâo Tan, Confucius spoke to him of benevolence and righteousness. \nLâo Tan said, 'If you winnow chaff, and the dust gets into your eyes, then the places \nof heaven and earth and of the four cardinal points are all changed to you. If musquitoes \nor gadflies puncture your skin, it will keep you all the night from sleeping. But this \npainful iteration of benevolence and righteousness excites my mind and produces in it \nthe greatest confusion. If you, Sir, would cause men not to lose their natural simplicity, \nand if you would also imitate the wind in its (unconstrained) movements, and stand forth \nin all the natural attributes belonging to you!—why must you use so much energy, \nand carry a great drum to seek for the son whom you have lost? The snow-goose does \nnot bathe every day to make itself white, nor the crow blacken itself every day to make \nitself black. The natural simplicity of their black and white does not afford any ground \nfor controversy; and the fame and praise which men like to contemplate do not make them \ngreater than they naturally are. When the springs (supplying the pools) are dried up, \nthe fishes huddle together on the dry land. Than that they should moisten one another \nthere by their gasping, and keep one another wet by their milt, it would be better for \nthem to forget one another in the rivers and lakes.'\n\nFrom this interview with Lâo Tan, Confucius returned home, and for three days did not \nspeak. His disciples (then) asked him, saying, 'Master, you have seen Lâo Tan; in what \nway might you admonish and correct him?' Confucius said, 'In him (I may say) that I have \nnow seen the dragon. The dragon coils itself up, and there is its body; it unfolds itself \nand becomes the dragon complete. It rides on the cloudy air, and is nourished by the Yin \nand Yang. I kept my mouth open, and was unable to shut it;—how could I admonish and \ncorrect Lâo Tan?'\n\n7. Dze-kung said, \n'So then, can (this) man indeed sit still as a representative of \nthe dead, and then appear as the dragon? Can his voice resound as thunder, when he is \nprofoundly still? Can he exhibit himself in his movements like heaven and earth? May I, \nZhze, also get to see him?' Accordingly with a message from Confucius he went to see Lâo \nTan.\n\nLâo Tan was then about to answer (his salutation) haughtily in the hall, but he said in \na low voice, 'My years have rolled on and are passing away, what do you, Sir, wish to \nadmonish me about?' Dze-kung replied, 'The Three Kings and Five Tîs ruled\n\nthe world not in the same way, but the fame that has accrued to them is the same. How \nis it that you alone consider that they were not sages?' 'Come forward a little, my son. \nWhy do you say that (their government) was not the same?' 'Yâo,' was the reply, 'gave \nthe kingdom to Shun, and Shun gave it to Yü. Yü had recourse to his strength, and Thang \nto the force of arms. King Wän was obedient to Kâu (-hsin), and did not dare to rebel; \nking Wû rebelled against Kâu, and would not submit to him. And I say that their methods \nwere not the same.' Lâo Tan said, 'Come a little more forward, my son, and I will tell \nyou how the Three Hwangs and the Five Tîs ruled the world. Hwang-Tî ruled it, so as \nto make the minds of the people all conformed to the One (simplicity). If the parents \nof one of them died, and he did not wail, no one blamed him. Yâo ruled it so as to cause \nthe hearts of the people to cherish relative affection. If any, however, made the observances \non the death of other members of their kindred less than those for their parents, no one \nblamed them. \nShun ruled it, so as to produce a feeling of rivalry in the minds of the \npeople. Their wives gave birth to their children in the tenth month of their pregnancy, \nbut those children could speak at five months; and before they were three years old, they \nbegan to call people by their surnames and names. Then it was that men began to die prematurely. \nYü ruled it, so as to cause the minds of the people to become changed. Men's minds became \nscheming, and they used their weapons as if they might legitimately do so, (saying that they were) killing \nthieves and not killing other men. The people formed themselves into different combinations;—so \nit was throughout the kingdom. Everywhere there was great consternation, and then arose \nthe Literati and (the followers of) Mo (Tî). From them came first the doctrine of the \nrelationships (of society); and what can be said of the now prevailing customs (in the \nmarrying of) wives and daughters? I tell you that the rule of the Three Kings and Five \nTîs may be called by that name, but nothing can be greater than the disorder which it \nproduced. The wisdom of the Three Kings was opposed to the brightness of the sun and moon \nabove, contrary to the exquisite purity of the hills and streams below, and subversive \nof the beneficent gifts of the four seasons between. Their wisdom has been more fatal \nthan the sting of a scorpion or the bite of a dangerous beast. Unable to rest in the \ntrue attributes of their nature and constitution, they still regarded themselves as sages:—was \nit not a thing to be ashamed of? But they were shameless.' Dze-kung stood quite disconcerted \nand ill at ease.\n\n8. Confucius said to Lâo Tan, 'I have occupied myself with the Shih, the Shû, the Lî, \nthe Yo, the Yî, and the Khun Khiû, those six Books, for what I myself consider a long \ntime, and am thoroughly\n\nacquainted with their contents. With seventy-two rulers, all offenders against the right, \nI have discoursed about the ways of the former kings, and set forth the examples of (the \ndukes of Kâu and Shâo; and not one of them has adopted (my views) and put them in practice:—how \nvery difficult it is to prevail on such men, and to make clear the path to be pursued!'\n\nLâo-dze replied, 'It is fortunate that you have not met with a ruler fitted to rule the \nage. Those six writings are a description of the vestiges left by the former kings, but \ndo not tell how they made such vestiges; and what you, Sir, speak about are still only \nthe vestiges. But vestiges are the prints left by the shoes;—are they the shoes that \nproduced them? A pair of white herons look at each other with pupils that do not move, \nand impregnation takes place; the male insect emits its buzzing sound in the air above, \nand the female responds from the air below, and impregnation takes place; the creatures \ncalled lêi are both male and female, and each individual breeds of itself. The nature \ncannot be altered; the conferred constitution cannot be changed; the march of the seasons \ncannot be arrested; the Tâo cannot be stopped. If you get the Tâo, there is no effect \nthat cannot be produced; if you miss it, there is no effect that can.'\n\nConfucius (after this) did not go out, till at the end of three months he went again to \nsee Lâo Tan, and said, 'I have got it. Ravens produce their young by hatching; fishes \nby the communication of their milt; the small-waisted wasp by\n\ntransformation; when \na younger brother comes, the elder weeps. Long is it that I \nhave not played my part in harmony with these processes of transformation. But as I did \nnot play my part in harmony with such transformation, how could I transform men?' Lâo-dze \nsaid, 'You will do. Khiû, you have found the Tâo.'\n"

    "BOOK XV. KHO Î.": "\n1. Ingrained ideas and a high estimate of their own conduct; leaving the world, and pursuing \nuncommon ways; talking loftily and in resentful disparagement of others;—all this \nis simply symptomatic of arrogance. This is what scholars who betake themselves to the \nhills and valleys, who are always blaming the world, and who stand aloof like withered \ntrees, or throw themselves into deep pools, are fond of.\n\nDiscoursing of benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and good faith; being humble and frugal, \nself-forgetful and courteous;—all this is simply symptomatic of (self-)cultivation. \nThis is what scholars who wish to tranquillise the world, teachers and instructors, men \nwho pursue their studies at home and abroad, are fond of.\n\nDiscoursing of their great merit and making a great name for themselves; insisting on \nthe ceremonies between ruler and minister; and rectifying the relations between high and \nlow;—all this shows their one object to be the promotion of government. This is what \nofficers of the court, men who honour their lord and would strengthen the state and who\n\nwould do their utmost to incorporate other states with their own, are fond of\n\nResorting to marshes and lakes; dwelling in solitary places; occupying themselves with \nangling and living at ease;—all this shows their one object to be to do nothing. \nThis is what gentlemen of the rivers and seas, men who avoid the society of the world \nand desire to live at leisure, are fond of.\n\nBlowing and breathing with open mouth; inhaling and exhaling the breath; expelling the \nold breath and taking in new; passing their time like the (dormant) bear, and stretching \nand twisting (the neck) like a bird;—all \nthis simply shows the desire for longevity. \nThis is what the scholars who manipulate their breath, and the men who nourish the body \nand wish to live as long as Päng Zû, are fond of.\n\nAs to those who have a lofty character without any ingrained ideas; who pursue the path \nof self-cultivation without benevolence and righteousness; who succeed in government without \ngreat services or fame; who enjoy their ease without resorting to the rivers and seas; \nwho attain to longevity without the management (of the breath); who forget all things \nand yet possess all things; whose placidity is unlimited, while all things to be valued \nattend them:—such men pursue the way of heaven and earth, and display the characteristics \nof the sages. Hence it is said, \n'Placidity, indifference, silence, quietude,\n\nabsolute vacancy, and non-action:—these are the qualities which maintain the level \nof heaven and earth and are the substance of the Tâo and its characteristics.'\n\n2. In accordance with this it is said, 'The sage is entirely restful, and so (his mind) \nis evenly balanced and at ease. This even balance and ease appears in his placidity and \nindifference. In this state of even balance and ease, of placidity and indifference, anxieties \nand evils do not find access to him, no depraving influence can take him by surprise; \nhis virtue is complete, and his spirit continues unimpaired.'\n\nTherefore it is (also) said, 'The life of the sage is (like) the action of Heaven; and \nhis death is the transformation common to (all) things. In his stillness his virtue is \nthe same as that of the Yin, and in movement his diffusiveness is like that of the Yang. \nHe does not take the initiative in producing either happiness or calamity. He responds \nto the influence acting on him, and moves as he feels the pressure. He rises to act only \nwhen he is obliged to do so. He discards wisdom and the memories of the past; he follows \nthe lines of his Heaven (-given nature); and therefore he suffers no calamity from Heaven, \nno involvement from things, no blame from men, and no reproof from the spirits of the \ndead. His life \nseems to float along; his death seems to be a resting. He does not indulge \nany\n\nanxious doubts; he does not lay plans beforehand. His light is without display; his good \nfaith is without previous arrangement. His sleep is untroubled by dreams; his waking is \nfollowed by no sorrows. His spirit is guileless and pure; his soul is not subject to weariness. \nVacant and without self-assertion, placid and indifferent, he agrees with the virtue of \nHeaven.'\n\nTherefore it is said (further), 'Sadness and pleasure show a depraving element in the \nvirtue (of those who feel them); joy and anger show some error in their course; love and \nhatred show a failure of their virtue. Hence for the mind to be free from sorrow and pleasure \nis the perfection of virtue; to be of one mind that does not change is the perfection \nof quietude; to be conscious of no opposition is the perfection of vacancy; to have no \nintercourse with (external) things is the perfection of indifference; and to have no rebellious \ndissatisfactions is the perfection of purity.'\n\n3. Therefore it is said (still further), 'If the body be toiled, and does not rest, it \nbecomes worn out; if the spirit be used without cessation, it becomes toiled; and when \ntoiled, it becomes exhausted. It is the nature of water, when free from admixture, to \nbe clear, and, when not agitated, to be level; while if obstructed and not allowed to \nflow, it cannot preserve its clearness;—being an image of the virtue of Heaven.' \nHence it is said (once again), 'To be guileless and pure, and free from all admixture; \nto be still and uniform, without undergoing any change; to be indifferent and do nothing; \nto move and yet to act like Heaven:—this is the way to nourish the spirit. Now he \nwho possesses a\n\nsword made at Kan-yüeh \npreserves it carefully in a box, and does not dare to use it;—it \nis considered the perfection of valuable swords. But the human spirit goes forth in \nall directions, flowing on without limit, reaching to heaven above, and wreathing round \nthe earth beneath. It transforms and nourishes all things, and cannot be represented by \nany form. Its name is \"the Divinity (in man).\" It is only the path of pure simplicity \nwhich guards and preserves the Spirit. When this path is preserved and not lost, it becomes \none with the Spirit; and in this ethereal amalgamation, it acts in harmony with the orderly \noperation of Heaven.'\n\nThere is the vulgar saying, 'The multitude of men consider gain to be the most important \nthing; pure scholars, fame; those who are wise and able value their ambition; the sage \nprizes essential purity.' Therefore simplicity is the denomination of that in which there \nis no admixture; purity of that in which the spirit is not impaired. It is he who can \nembody simplicity and purity whom we call the True Man.\n"

    "BOOK XVI. SHAN HSING.": "\n1. Those who would correct their nature by means of the vulgar learning, seeking to \nrestore it to its original condition, and those who would regulate their desires, by \nthe vulgar ways of thinking, seeking thereby to carry their intelligence to perfection, \nmust be pronounced to be deluded and ignorant people. The ancients who regulated the Tâo \nnourished their faculty of knowledge by their placidity, and all through life abstained \nfrom employing that faculty in action;—they must be pronounced to have (thus also) \nnourished their placidity by their knowledge.\n\nWhen the faculty of knowledge and the placidity\n\n(thus) blend together, and they nourish each other, then from the nature there come forth \nharmony and orderly method. The attributes (of the Tâo) constitute the harmony; the Tâo \n(itself) secures the orderly method. When the attributes appear in a universal practice \nof forbearance, we have Benevolence; when the path is all marked by orderly method, we \nhave Righteousness; when the righteousness is clearly manifested, and (all) things are \nregarded with affection, we have Leal-heartedness; when the (heart's) core is thus (pure) \nand real, and carried back to its (proper) qualities, we have Music; when this sincerity \nappears in all the range of the capacity, and its demonstrations are in accordance with \nwhat is elegant, we have Ceremony. If Ceremonies and Music are carried out in an imperfect \nand one-sided manner, the world is thrown into confusion. When men would rectify others, \nand their own virtue is beclouded, it is not sufficient to extend itself to them. If an \nattempt be made so to extend it, they also will lose their (proper) nature.\n\n2. The men of old, while the chaotic condition was yet undeveloped, shared the placid \ntranquillity which belonged to the whole world. At that time the Yin and Yang were harmonious \nand still; their resting and movement proceeded without any disturbance; the four seasons \nhad their definite times; not a single thing received any injury, and no living being \ncame to a premature end. Men might be\n\npossessed of (the faculty of) knowledge, but they had no occasion for its use. This was \nwhat is called the state of Perfect Unity. At this time, there was no action on the part \nof any one, but a constant manifestation of spontaneity.\n\nThis condition (of excellence) deteriorated and decayed, till Sui-zän and Fû-hsî arose \nand commenced their administration of the world; on which came a compliance (with their \nmethods), but the state of unity was lost. The condition going on to deteriorate and decay, \nShän Näng and Hwang-Tî arose, and took the administration of the world, on which (the \npeople) rested (in their methods), but did not themselves comply with them. Still the \ndeterioration and decay continued till the lords of Thang and Yü began to administer \nthe world. These introduced the method of governing by transformation, resorting to the \nstream (instead of to the spring), \nthus vitiating the purity and destroying the simplicity \n(of the nature). They left the Tâo, and substituted the Good for it, and pursued the course \nof Haphazard Virtue. After this they forsook their nature and followed (the promptings \nof) their minds. One mind and another associated their knowledge, but were unable to give \nrest to the world. Then they added to this knowledge (external\n\nand) elegant forms, and went on to make these more and more numerous. The forms extinguished \nthe (primal) simplicity, till the mind was drowned by their multiplicity. After this the \npeople began to be perplexed and disordered, and had no way by which they might return \nto their true nature, and bring back their original condition.\n\n3. Looking at the subject from this point of view, we see how the world lost the (proper) \ncourse, and how the course (which it took) only led it further astray. The world and \nthe Way, when they came together, being (thus) lost to each other, how could the men of \nthe Way make themselves conspicuous in the world? and how could the world rise to an appreciation \nof the Way? Since the Way had no means to make itself conspicuous in the world, and the \nworld had no means of rising to an appreciation of the Way, though sagely men might not \nkeep among the hills and forests, their virtue was hidden;—hidden, but not because \nthey themselves sought to hide it.\n\nThose whom the ancients called 'Retired Scholars' did not conceal their persons, and not \nallow themselves to be seen; they did not shut up their words, and refuse to give utterance \nto them; they did not hide away their knowledge, and refuse to bring it forth. The conditions \nlaid on them by the times were very much awry. If the conditions of the times had allowed \nthem to act in the world on a great scale, they would have brought back the state of unity \nwithout any trace being perceived (of how\n\nthey did so), When those conditions shut them up entirely from such action, they struck \ntheir roots deeper (in themselves), were perfectly still and waited. It was thus that \nthey preserved (the Way in) their own persons.\n\n4. The ancients who preserved (the Way in) their own persons did not try by sophistical \nreasonings to gloss over their knowledge; they did not seek to embrace (everything in) \nthe world in their knowledge, nor to comprehend all the virtues in it. Solitary and trembling \nthey remained where they were, and sought the restoration of their nature. What had they \nto do with any further action? The Way indeed is not to be pursued, nor (all) its characteristics \nto be known on a small scale. A little knowledge is injurious to those characteristics; \nsmall doings are injurious to the Way;—hence it is said, 'They simply rectified themselves.' \nComplete enjoyment is what is meant by 'the Attainment of the Aim.'\n\nWhat was anciently called 'the Attainment of the Aim' did not mean the getting of carriages \nand coronets; it \nsimply meant that nothing more was needed for their enjoyment. Now-a-days \nwhat is called 'the Attainment of the Aim' means the getting of carriages and coronets. \nBut carriages and coronets belong to the body; they do not affect the nature as it is \nconstituted. When such things happen to come, it is but for a time; being but for a time, \ntheir coming cannot be obstructed and their going cannot be stopped. Therefore we should not\n\nbecause of carriages and coronets indulge our aims, nor because of distress and straitness \nresort to the vulgar (learning and thinking); the one of these conditions and the other \nmay equally conduce to our enjoyment, which is simply to be free from anxiety. If now \nthe departure of what is transient takes away one's enjoyment, this view shows that what \nenjoyment it had given was worthless. Hence it is said, 'They who lose themselves in their \npursuit of things, and lose their nature in their study of what is vulgar, must be pronounced \npeople who turn things upside down.'\n"

    "BOOK XVII. KHIÛ SHUI.": "\n1. The time of the autumnal floods was come, and the hundred streams were all discharging \nthemselves into the Ho. Its current was greatly swollen, so that across its channel \nfrom bank to bank one could not distinguish an ox from a horse. On this the (Spirit-) \nearl of the Ho laughed \nwith delight, thinking that all the beauty of the world was \nto be found in his charge. Along the course of the river he walked east till he came to \nthe North Sea, over which he looked, with his face to the east, without being able to \nsee where its waters began. Then he began to turn his face round, looked across the expanse, \n(as if he were) confronting Zo, \nand said with a sigh, 'What the vulgar saying expresses \nabout him who has learned a hundred points (of the Tâo), and thinks that there is no one \nequal to himself, was surely spoken of me. And moreover, I have heard\n\nparties making little of the knowledge of Kung-nî and the righteousness of Po-î, and at \nfirst I did not believe them. Now I behold the all-but-boundless extent (of your realms). \nIf I had not come to your gate, I should have been in danger (of continuing in my ignorance), \nand been laughed at for long in the schools of our great System.'\n\nZo, (the Spirit-lord) of the Northern Sea, said, 'A frog in a well cannot be talked with \nabout the sea;—he is confined to the limits of his hole. An insect of the summer \ncannot be talked with about ice;—it knows nothing beyond its own season. A scholar \nof limited views cannot be talked with about the Tâo;—he is bound by the teaching \n(which he has received). Now you have come forth from between your banks, and beheld the \ngreat sea. You have come to know your own ignorance and inferiority, and are in the way \nof being fitted to be talked with about great principles. Of all the waters under heaven \nthere are none so great as the sea. A myriad streams flow into it without ceasing, and \nyet it is not filled; and afterwards it discharges them (also) without ceasing, and \nyet it is not emptied. In spring and in autumn it undergoes no change; it takes no notice \nof floods or of drought. Its superiority over such streams even as the Kiang and the\n\nHo cannot be told by measures or numbers; and that I have never, notwithstanding this, \nmade much of myself, is because I compare my own bodily form with (the greatness of) heaven \nand earth, and (remember that) I have received my breath from the Yin and Yang. Between \nheaven and earth I am but as a small stone or a small tree on a great hill. So long as \nI see myself to be thus small, how should I make much of myself? I estimate all within \nthe four seas, compared with the space between heaven and earth, to be not so large as \nthat occupied by a pile of stones in a large marsh! I estimate our Middle States, compared \nwith the space between the four seas, to be smaller than a single little grain of rice \nin a great granary! When we would set forth the number of things (in existence), we speak \nof them as myriads; and man is only one of them. Men occupy all the nine provinces; but \nof all whose life is maintained by grain-food, wherever boats and carriages reach, men \nform only one portion. Thus, compared with the myriads of things, they are not equal to \na single fine hair on the body of a horse. Within this range are comprehended all (the \nterritories) which the five Tîs received in succession from one another; all which the \nroyal founders of the three dynasties contended for; all which excited the anxiety of \nBenevolent men; and all which men in office have toiled for. Po-î was accounted famous \nfor declining (to share in its government), and Kung-nî was accounted great because of \nthe lessons which he addressed to it. They acted as they did, making much of themselves;—therein \nlike you who a little time ago did so of yourself because of your (volume of) water!'\n\n2. The earl of the Ho said, 'Well then, may I consider heaven and earth as (the ideal \nof) what is great, and the point of a hair as that of what is small?' Zo of the Northern \nSea replied, 'No. The (different) capacities of things are illimitable; time never stops, \n(but is always moving on); man's lot is ever changing; the end and the beginning of things \nnever occur (twice) in the same way. Therefore men of great wisdom, looking at things \nfar off or near at hand, do not think them insignificant for being small, nor much of \nthem for being great:—knowing how capacities differ illimitably. They appeal with \nintelligence to things of ancient and recent occurrence, without being troubled by the \nremoteness of the former, or standing on tiptoe to lay hold of the latter:—knowing \nthat time never stops in its course. They examine with discrimination (cases of) fulness \nand of want, not overjoyed by success, nor disheartened by failure:—knowing the inconstancy \nof man's lot. They know the plain and quiet path (in which things proceed), therefore \nthey are not overjoyed to live, nor count it a calamity to die: the end and the beginning \nof things never occurring (twice) in the same way.\n\n'We must reckon that what men know is not so much as what they do not know, and that the \ntime since they were born is not so long as that which elapsed before they were born. \nWhen they take that which is most small and try to fill with it the dimensions of what \nis most great, this leads to error and confusion, and they cannot attain their end. Looking \nat the subject in this way, how can you know that the point of a hair is sufficient to \ndetermine the minuteness of what is most small, or that\n\nheaven and earth are sufficient to complete the dimensions of what is most large?'\n\n3. The earl of the Ho said, 'The disputers of the world all say, \"That which is most minute \nhas no bodily form; and that which is most great cannot be encompassed;\"—is this \nreally the truth?' Zo of the Northern Sea replied, 'When from the standpoint of what is \nsmall we look at what is great, we do not take it all in; when from the standpoint of \nwhat is great we look at what is small, we do not see it clearly. Now the subtile essence \nis smallness in its extreme degree; and the vast mass is greatness in its largest form. \nDifferent as they are, each has its suitability,—according to their several conditions. \nBut the subtile and the gross both presuppose that they have a bodily form. Where there \nis no bodily form, there is no longer a possibility of numerical division; where it is \nnot possible to encompass a mass, there is no longer a possibility of numerical estimate. \nWhat can be discoursed about in words is the grossness of things; what can be reached \nin idea is the subtilty of things. What cannot be discoursed about in words, and what \ncannot be reached by nice discrimination of thought, has nothing to do either with subtilty \nor grossness.\n\n'Therefore while the actions of the Great Man are not directed to injure men, he does \nnot plume himself on his benevolence and kindness; while his movements are not made with \na view to gain, he does not consider the menials of a family as mean; while he does not \nstrive after property and wealth, he does not plume himself on declining them; while he \ndoes not borrow the help of others to accomplish his affairs, he does not plume himself \non supporting\n\nhimself by his own strength, nor does he despise those who in their greed do what is mean; \nwhile he differs in his conduct from the vulgar, he does not plume himself on being so \ndifferent from them; while it is his desire to follow the multitude, he does not despise \nthe glib-tongued flatterers. The rank and emoluments of the world furnish no stimulus \nto him, nor does he reckon its punishments and shame to be a disgrace. He knows that the \nright and the wrong can (often) not be distinguished, and that what is small and what \nis great can (often) not be defined. I have heard it said, \"The Man of Tâo does not become \ndistinguished; the greatest virtue is unsuccessful; the Great Man has no thought of self;\"—to \nso great a degree may the lot be restricted.'\n\n4. The earl of the Ho said, 'Whether the subject be what is external in things, or what \nis internal, how do we come to make a distinction between them as noble and mean, and \nas great or small?' Zo of the Northern Sea replied, 'When we look at them in the light \nof the Tâo, they are neither noble nor mean. Looking at them in themselves, each thinks \nitself noble, and despises others. Looking at them in the light of common opinion, their \nbeing noble or mean does not depend on themselves. Looking at them in their differences \nfrom one another, if we call those great which are greater than others, there is nothing \nthat is not great, and in the same way there is nothing that is not small. We shall (thus) \nknow that heaven and earth is but (as) a grain of the smallest rice, and that the point \nof a hair is (as) a mound or a mountain;—such is the view given of them by their \nrelative size. Looking\n\nat them from the services they render, allowing to everything the service which it does, \nthere is not one which is not serviceable; and, extending the consideration to what it \ndoes not do, there is not one which is not unserviceable. We know (for instance) that \nEast and West are opposed to each other, and yet that the one cannot be without (suggesting \nthe idea of) the other;—(thus) their share of mutual service is determined. Looking \nat them with respect to their tendencies, if we approve of what they approve, then there \nis no one who may not be approved of; and, if we condemn what they condemn, there is no \none who may not be condemned. There are the cases of Yâo and Kieh, each of whom approved \nof his own course, and condemned the other;—such is the view arising from the consideration \nof tendency and aim.\n\n'Formerly Yâo and Shun resigned (their thrones), and yet each continued to be Tî; Kih-khwâi \nresigned (his marquisate) which led to his ruin. Thang and Wû contended (for the sovereignty), \nand each became king; the duke of Pâi \ncontended (for Khû), which led to his extinction. \nLooking at the subject from these examples of striving by force and of resigning, and \nfrom the conduct of Yâo (on the one hand) and of Kieh (on the other), we see that there \nis a time for noble acting, and a time for\n\nmean;—these characteristics are subject to no regular rule.\n\n5. 'A battering ram may be used against the wall of a city, but it cannot be employed \nto stop up a hole;—the uses of implements are different. The (horses) Khih-kî and \nHwâ-liû could in one \nday gallop 1000 lî, but for catching rats they were not equal \nto a wild dog or a weasel;—the gifts of creatures are different. The white horned \nowl collects its fleas in the night-time, and can discern the point of a hair, but in \nbright day it stares with its eyes and cannot see a mound or a hill;—the natures \nof creatures are different.\n\n'Hence the sayings, \"Shall we not follow and honour the right, and have nothing to do \nwith the wrong? shall we not follow and honour those who secure good government, and have \nnothing to do with those who produce disorder?\" show a want of acquaintance with the principles \nof Heaven and Earth, and with the different qualities of things. It is like following \nand honouring Heaven and taking no account of Earth; it is like following and honouring \nthe Yin and taking no account of the Yang. It is clear that such a course cannot be pursued. \nYet notwithstanding they go on talking so:—if they are not stupid, they are visionaries. \nThe Tî sovereigns resigned their thrones to others in one way, and the rulers of the three \ndynasties transmitted their thrones to their successors in another. He who acts differently \nfrom the requirements of his time and contrary to its custom is called an usurper; he \nwho complies with the time\n\nand follows the common practice is said to be righteous. Hold your peace, O earl of the \nHo. How should you know what constitutes being noble and being mean, or who are the small \nand who the great?'\n\n6. The earl of the Ho said, 'Very well. But what am I to do? and what am I not to do? \nHow am I to be guided after all in regard to what I accept or reject, and what I pursue \nor put away from me?' Zo of the Northern Sea replied, 'From the standpoint of the Tâo, \nwhat is noble? and what is mean? These expressions are but the different extremes of the \naverage level. Do not keep pertinaciously to your own ideas, which put you in such opposition \nto the Tâo. What are few? and what are many? These are denominations which we employ in \nthanking (donors) and dispensing gifts. Do not study to be uniform in doing so;—it \nonly shows how different you are from the Tâo. Be severe and strict, like the ruler of \na state who does not selfishly bestow his favours. Be scrupulous, yet gentle, like the \ntutelary spirit of the land, when sacrifice is offered to him who does not bestow his \nblessing selfishly. Be large-minded like space, whose four terminating points are illimitable, \nand form no particular enclosures. Hold all things in your love, favouring and supporting \nnone specially. This is called being without any local or partial regard; all things are \nequally regarded; there is no long or short among them.\n\n'There is no end or beginning to the Tâo. Things indeed die and are born, not reaching \na perfect state which can be relied on. Now there is emptiness, and now fulness;—they \ndo not continue in one form. The years cannot be reproduced; time\n\ncannot be arrested. Decay and growth, fulness and emptiness, when they end, begin again. \nIt is thus that we describe the method of great righteousness, and discourse about the \nprinciple pervading all things. The life of things is like the hurrying and galloping \nalong of a horse. With every movement there is a change; with every moment there is an \nalteration. What should you be doing? what should you not be doing? You have only to be \nallowing this course of natural transformation to be going on.'\n\n7. The earl of the Ho said, 'What then is there so valuable in the Tâo?' Zo of the Northern \nSea replied, 'He who knows the Tâo, is sure to be well acquainted with the principles \n(that appear in the procedures of things). Acquainted with (those) principles, he is sure \nto understand how to regulate his conduct in all varying circumstances. Having that understanding, \nhe will not allow things to injure himself. Fire cannot burn him who is (so) perfect in \nvirtue, nor water drown him; neither cold nor heat can affect him injuriously; neither \nbird nor beast can hurt him. This does not mean that he is indifferent to these things; \nit means that he discriminates between where he may safely rest and where he will be in \nperil; that he is tranquil equally in calamity and happiness; that he is careful what \nhe avoids and what he approaches;—so that nothing can injure him. Hence it is said, \n\"What is heavenly is internal; what is human is external.\" The virtue (of man) is in what \nis Heavenly. If you know the operation of what is Heavenly and what is Human, you will \nhave your root in what is Heavenly and your position in Virtue. You will bend or stretch\n\n(only) after the (necessary) hesitation; you will have returned to the essential, and \nmay be pronounced to have reached perfection.'\n\n'What do you mean,' pursued the earl, 'by the Heavenly, and by the Human?' Zo replied, \n'Oxen and horses have four feet;—that is what I call their Heavenly (constitution). \nWhen horses' heads are haltered, and the noses of oxen are pierced, that is what I call \n(the doing of) Man. Hence it is said, \"Do not by the Human (doing) extinguish the Heavenly \n(constitution); do not for your (Human) purpose extinguish the appointment (of Heaven); \ndo not bury your (proper) fame in (such) a pursuit of it; carefully guard (the Way) and \ndo not lose it:—this is what I call reverting to your True (Nature).\"'\n\n8. The khwei desires to \nbe like the millipede; the millipede to be like the serpent; \nthe serpent like the wind; the wind to be like the eye; and the eye to be like the mind.\n\nThe khwei said to the millipede, 'With my one leg I hop about, and can hardly manage to \ngo along. Now you have a myriad feet which you can employ; how is it that you are so abundantly \nfurnished?' The millipede said, 'It is not so. Have you not seen one ejecting saliva? \nThe largest portion of it is like a pearl, while the smaller portions fall down like a \nshower of mist in innumerable\n\ndrops. Now I put in motion the springs set in me by Heaven, without knowing how I do so.'\n\nThe millipede said to the serpent, 'I go along by means of my multitude of feet; and yet \nhow is it that I do not go so fast as you who have no feet at all?' The serpent replied, \n'How can the method of moving by the springs set in us by Heaven be changed? How could \nI make use of feet?'\n\nThe serpent said to the wind, 'I get along by moving my backbone and ribs, thus appearing \nto have some (bodily) means of progression. But now you, Sir, rise with a blustering force \nin the North Sea, and go on in the same way to the South Sea;—seemingly without any \nsuch means. How does it take place?' The wind said, 'Yes. With such a blustering force \nI rise in the North Sea and go on to the: South Sea. But you can point to me, and therein \nare superior to me, as you are also in treading on me. Yet notwithstanding, it is only \nI who can break great trees, and blow down great houses. Therefore he whom all that are \nsmall cannot overcome is a great overcomer. But it is only he who is the sagely man \nthat is the Great Conqueror (of all).'\n\n9. When Confucius was travelling in Khwang,\n\nsome people of Sung (once) surrounded him (with a hostile intention) several ranks deep; \nbut he kept singing to his lute without stopping. Dze-lû came in, and saw him, and said, \n'How is it, Master, that you are so pleased?' Confucius said, 'Come here, and I will tell \nyou. I have tried to avoid being reduced to such a strait for a long time; and that I \nhave not escaped shows that it was so appointed for me. I have sought to find a ruler \nthat would employ me for a long time, and that I have not found one, shows the character \nof the time. Under Yâo and Shun there was no one in the kingdom reduced to straits like \nmine; and it was not by their sagacity that men succeeded as they did. Under Kieh and \nKâu no (good and able man) in the kingdom found his way to employment; and it was not \nfor (want of) sagacity that they failed to do so. It was simply owing to the times and \ntheir character.\n\n2. People that do business on the water do not shrink from meeting iguanodons and dragons;—that \nis the courage of fishermen. Those who do business on land do not shrink from meeting \nrhinoceroses and tigers;—that is the courage of hunters. When men see the sharp weapons \ncrossed before them, and look on death as going home;—that is the courage of the \ndetermined soldier. When he knows that his strait is determined for him, and that the \nemployment of him by a ruler depends on the character of the time, and then meeting with \ngreat distress is yet not afraid;-that is the courage of the sagely man. Wait, my good \nYû, and you will see what there is determined for me in my lot.' A little afterwards, \nthe leader of the armed men approached and took his leave, saying, 'We thought you were\n\nYang Hû, and therefore \nsurrounded you. Now we see our mistake.' (With this) he begged to take his leave, and withdrew.\n\n10. Kung-sun Lung asked Mâu \nof Wei, saying, 'When \nI was young, I learned the teachings \nof the former kings; and when I was grown up, I became proficient in the practice of benevolence \nand righteousness. I brought together the views that agreed and disagreed; I considered \nthe questions about hardness and whiteness; I set forth what was to be affirmed and \nwhat was not, and what was allowable and what was not; I studied painfully the various \nschools of thought, and made myself master of the reasonings of all their masters. I thought \nthat I had reached a good understanding of every subject; but now that I have heard the \nwords of Kwang-dze, they throw me into a flutter of surprise. I do not know whether it \nbe that I do not come up to him in the power of discussion, or that my knowledge is not \nequal to his. But now I do not feel able to open my mouth, and venture to ask you what \ncourse I should pursue.' Kung-dze Mâu leant forward on his stool, drew a long breath, \nlooked up to heaven, smiled, and\n\nsaid, 'Have you not heard of the frog of the dilapidated well, and how it said to the \nturtle of the Eastern Sea, \"How I enjoy myself? I leap upon the parapet of this well. \nI enter, and having by means of the projections formed by the fragments of the broken \ntiles of the lining proceeded to the water, I draw my legs together, keep my chin up, \n(and strike out). When I have got to the mud, I dive till my feet are lost in it. Then \nturning round, I see that of the shrimps, crabs, and tadpoles there is not one that can \ndo like me. Moreover, when one has entire command of all the water in the gully, and hesitates \nto go forward, it is the greatest pleasure to enjoy one's self here in this dilapidated \nwell;—why \ndo not you, Master, often come and enter, and see it for yourself? \"The \nturtle of the Eastern Sea (was then proceeding to go forward), but before he had put in \nhis left foot, he found his right knee caught and held fast. On this he hesitated, drew \nback, and told (the frog) all about the sea, saying, \"A distance of a thousand lî is not \nsufficient to express its extent, nor would (a line of) eight thousand cubits be equal \nto sound its depth. In the time of Yü, for nine years out of ten the flooded land (all \ndrained into it), and its water was not sensibly increased; and in the time of Thang for \nseven years out of eight there was a drought, but the rocks on the shore (saw) no diminution \nof the water because of it. Thus it is that no change is produced in its waters by any \ncause operating for a short time or a long, and that they do not advance nor recede for \nany addition or subtraction, whether great or small; and this is the great pleasure afforded \nby the Eastern Sea.\" When\n\nthe frog of the dilapidated well heard this, he was amazed and terror-struck, and lost \nhimself in surprise.\n\n'And moreover, when you, who have not wisdom enough to know where the discussions about \nwhat is right and what is wrong should end, still desire to see through the words of Kwang-dze, \nthat is like employing a mosquito to carry a mountain on its back, or a millipede to \ngallop as fast as the Ho runs;—tasks to which both the insects are sure to be unequal. \nStill further, when you, who have not wisdom enough to know the words employed in discussing \nvery mysterious subjects, yet hasten to show your sharpness of speech on any occasion \nthat may occur, is not this being like the frog of the dilapidated well?\n\n'And that (Kwang-dze) now plants his foot on the Yellow Springs (below the earth), and \nanon rises to the height of the Empyrean. Without any regard to south and north, with \nfreedom he launches out in every direction, and is lost in the unfathomable. Without any \nregard to east and west, starting from what is abysmally obscure, he comes back to what \nis grandly intelligible. (All the while), you, Sir, in amazement, search for his views \nto examine them, and grope among them for matter for discussion;—this is just like \npeeping at the heavens through a tube, or aiming at the earth with an awl; are not both \nthe implements too small for the purpose? Go your ways, Sir.\n\n'And have you not heard of the young learners of\n\nShâu-ling, and how they \ndid in Han-tan? Before they had acquired what they might have \ndone in that capital, they had forgotten what they had learned to do in their old city, \nand were marched back to it on their hands and knees. If now you do not go away, you will \nforget your old acquirements, and fail in your profession.'\n\nKung-sun Lung gaped on the speaker, and could not shut his mouth, and his tongue clave \nto its roof. He slank away and ran off.\n\n11. Kwang-dze was (once) fishing in the river Phû, when the king of Khû sent two \ngreat officers to him, with the message, 'I wish to trouble you with the charge of all \nwithin my territories.' Kwang-dze kept on holding his rod without looking round, and said, \n'I have heard that in Khû there is a spirit-like tortoise-shell, the wearer of which died \n3000 years ago, \nand which the king keeps, in his ancestral temple, in a hamper covered \nwith a cloth. Was it better for the tortoise to die, and leave its shell to be thus honoured? \nOr would it have been better for it to live, and keep on dragging its tail through the \nmud?' The two officers said, 'It would have been better for it to live, and draw its tail \nafter it over the mud.' \n'Go your ways. I will keep on drawing my tail after me through \nthe mud.'\n\n12. Hui-dze being a minister of state in Liang, Kwang-dze went to see him. Some one \nhad told Hui-dze that Kwang-dze was come with a wish to supersede him in his office, on \nwhich he was afraid, and instituted a search for the stranger all over the kingdom for \nthree days and three nights. (After this) Kwang-dze went and saw him, and said, 'There \nis in the south a bird, called \"the Young Phoenix;\"—do you know it? Starting from \nthe South Sea, it flies to the Northern; never resting but on the bignonia, never eating \nbut the fruit of the melia azederach, and never drinking but from the purest springs. \nAn owl, which had got a putrid rat, (once), when a phoenix went passing overhead, looked \nup to it and gave an angry scream. Do you wish now, in your possession of the kingdom \nof Liang, to frighten me with a similar scream?'\n\n13. Kwang-dze and Hui-dze were walking on the dam over the Hâo, when the former said, \n'These thryssas come out, and play about at their ease;—that is the enjoyment of \nfishes.' The other said, 'You are not a fish; how do you know what\n\nconstitutes the enjoyment of fishes?' Kwang-dze rejoined, 'You are not I. How do you \nknow that I do not know what constitutes the enjoyment of fishes?' Hui-dze said, 'I am \nnot you; and though indeed I do not fully know you, you certainly are not a fish, and \n(the argument) is complete against your knowing what constitutes the happiness of fishes.' \nKwang-dze replied, 'Let us keep to your original question. You said to me, \"How do you \nknow what constitutes the enjoyment of fishes?\" You knew that I knew it, and yet you put \nyour question to me;—well, I know it (from our enjoying ourselves together) over \nthe Hâo.'\n"

    "BOOK XVIII. KIH LO.": "\n1. Under the sky is perfect enjoyment to be found or not? Are there any who can preserve \nthemselves alive or not? If there be, what do they do? What do they maintain? What do \nthey avoid? What do they attend to? Where do they resort to? Where do they keep from? \nWhat do they delight in? What do they dislike?\n\nWhat the world honours is riches, dignities, longevity, and being deemed able. What it \ndelights in is rest for the body, rich flavours, fine garments, beautiful colours, and \npleasant music. What it looks down on are poverty and mean condition, short life and being \ndeemed feeble. What men \nconsider bitter experiences are that their bodies do not get \nrest and case, that their mouths do not get food of rich flavour, that their persons are \nnot finely clothed, that their eyes do not see beautiful colours, and that their ears \ndo not listen to pleasant music. If they do not\n\nget these things, they are very sorrowful, and go on to be troubled with fears. Their \nthoughts are all about the body;—are they not silly?\n\nNow the rich embitter their lives by their incessant labours; they accumulate more wealth \nthan they can use:—while they act thus for the body, they make it external to themselves. \nThose who seek for honours carry their pursuit of them from the day into the night, full \nof anxiety about their methods whether they are skilful or not:—while they act thus \nfor the body they treat it as if it were indifferent to them. The birth of man is at \nthe same time the birth of his sorrow; and if he live long he becomes more and more stupid, \nand the longer is his anxiety that he may not die; how great is his bitterness!—while \nhe thus acts for his body, it is for a distant result. Meritorious officers are regarded \nby the world as good; but (their goodness) is not sufficient to keep their persons alive. \nI do not know whether the goodness ascribed to them be really good or really not good. \nIf indeed it be considered good, it is not sufficient to preserve their persons alive; \nif it be deemed not good, it is sufficient to preserve other men alive. Hence it is said, \n'When faithful remonstrances are not listened to, (the remonstrant) should sit still, \nlet (his ruler) take his course, and not strive with him.' Therefore when Dze-hsü strove \nwith (his ruler), he brought on himself\n\nthe mutilation of his body. If he had not so striven, he would not have acquired his fame:—was \nsuch (goodness) really good or was it not?\n\nAs to what the common people now do, and what they find their enjoyment in, I do not know \nwhether the enjoyment be really enjoyment or really not. I see them in their pursuit of \nit following after all their aims as if with the determination of death, and as if they \ncould not stop in their course; but what they call enjoyment would not be so to me, while \nyet I do not say that there is no enjoyment in it. Is there indeed such enjoyment, or \nis there not? I consider doing nothing (to obtain it) to be the great enjoyment, while \nordinarily people consider it to be a great evil. Hence it is said, 'Perfect enjoyment \nis to be without enjoyment; the highest praise is to be without praise.' The right \nand the wrong (on this point of enjoyment) cannot indeed be determined according to (the \nview of) the world; nevertheless, this doing nothing (to obtain it) may determine the \nright and the wrong. Since perfect enjoyment is (held to be) the keeping the body alive, \nit is only by this doing nothing that that end is likely to be secured. Allow me to try \nand explain this (more fully):—Heaven does nothing, and thence comes its serenity; \nEarth does nothing, and thence comes its rest. By the union of these two inactivities, \nall things are produced. How vast and imperceptible is the process!—they seem to \ncome from\n\nnowhere! How imperceptible and vast!—there is no visible image of it! All things \nin all their variety grow from this Inaction. Hence it is said, 'Heaven and Earth do nothing, \nand yet there is nothing that they do not do.' But what man is there that can attain to this inaction?\n\n2. When Kwang-dze's wife died, Hui-dze went to condole with him, and, finding him squatted \non the ground, drumming on the basin, and singing, said to him, 'When a wife has lived \nwith her husband, and brought up children, and then dies in her old age, not to wail for \nher is enough. When you go on to drum on this basin and sing, is it not an excessive (and \nstrange) demonstration?' Kwang-dze replied, 'It is not so. When she first died, was it \npossible for me to be singular and not affected by the event? But I reflected on the commencement \nof her being. She had \nnot yet been born to life; not only had she no life, but she \nhad no bodily form; not only bad she no bodily form, but she had no breath. During the \nintermingling of the waste and dark chaos, \nthere ensued a change, and there was breath; another change, and there was the bodily \nform; another change, and there came birth\n\nand life. There is now a change again, and she is dead. The relation between these things \nis like the procession of the four seasons from spring to autumn, from winter to summer. \nThere now she lies with her face up, sleeping in the Great Chamber; and if I were to \nfall sobbing and going on to wail for her, I should think that I did not understand what \nwas appointed (for all). I therefore restrained myself!'\n\n3. Mr. Deformed \nand Mr. One-foot were looking at the \nmound-graves of the departed \nin the wild of Khwän-lun, where Hwang-Tî had entered into his rest. Suddenly a tumour \nbegan to grow on their left wrists, which made them look distressed as if they disliked \nit. The former said to the other, 'Do\n\nyou dread it?' 'No,' replied he, 'why should I dread it? Life is a borrowed thing. The \nliving frame thus borrowed is but so much dust. Life and death are like day and night. \nAnd you and I were looking at (the graves of) those who have undergone their change. If \nmy change is coming to me, why should I dislike it?'\n\n4. When Kwang-dze went to Khû, he saw an empty skull, bleached indeed, but still retaining \nits shape. Tapping it with his horse-switch, he asked it, saying, 'Did you, Sir, in your \ngreed of life, fail in the lessons of reason, and come to this? Or did you do so, in the \nservice of a perishing state, by the punishment of the axe? Or was it through your evil \nconduct, reflecting disgrace on your parents and on your wife and children? Or was it \nthrough your hard endurances of cold and hunger? Or was it that you had completed your \nterm of life?'\n\nHaving given expression to these questions, he took up the skull, and made a pillow of \nit when he went to sleep. At midnight the skull appeared to him in a dream, and said,' \nWhat you said to me was after the fashion of an orator. All your words were about the \nentanglements of men in their lifetime. There are none of those things after death. Would \nyou like to hear me, Sir, tell you about death?' 'I should,' said Kwang-dze, and the skull \nresumed: 'In death there are not (the distinctions of) ruler above and minister below. \nThere are none of the phenomena of the four seasons. Tranquil and at ease, our years are \nthose of heaven and earth. No king in his court has greater enjoyment than we have.' Kwang-dze \ndid not believe it, and said, 'If I\n\ncould get the Ruler of our Destiny to restore your body to life with its bones and \nflesh and skin, and to give you back your father and mother, your wife and children, and \nall your village acquaintances, would you wish me to do so?' The skull stared fixedly \nat him, knitted its brows, and said, 'How should I cast away the enjoyment of my royal \ncourt, and undertake again the toils of life among mankind?'\n\n5. When Yen Yüan went eastwards to Khî, Confucius wore a look of sorrow. Dze-kung left \nhis mat, and asked him, saying, 'Your humble disciple ventures to ask how it is that the \ngoing eastwards of Hui to Khî has given you such a look of sadness.' Confucius said, 'Your \nquestion is good. Formerly Kwan-dze used words of which I very much approve. He said, \n\"A small bag cannot be made to contain what is large; a short rope cannot be used to draw \nwater from a deep well.\" \nSo it is, and man's appointed lot is definitely determined, \nand his body is adapted for definite ends, so that neither the one nor the other can be \naugmented or diminished. I am afraid that Hui will talk with the marquis of Khî about \nthe ways of Hwang-Tî, Yâo, and Shun, and go on to relate the words of Sui-zän and Shän \nNäng. The marquis will seek (for the correspondence of what he is told) in himself; and, \nnot finding\n\nit there, will suspect the speaker; and that speaker, being suspected, will be put to \ndeath. And have you not heard this?—Formerly a sea-bird alighted in the suburban \ncountry of Lû. \nThe marquis went out to meet it, (brought it) to the ancestral temple, \nand prepared to banquet it there. The Kiû-shâo was performed to afford it music; an \nox, a sheep, and a pig were killed to supply the food. The bird, however, looked at everything \nwith dim eyes, and was very sad. It did not venture to eat a single bit of flesh, nor \nto drink a single cupful; and in three days it died.\n\n'The marquis was trying to nourish the bird with what he used for himself, and not with \nthe nourishment proper for a bird. They who would nourish birds as they ought to be nourished \nshould let them perch in the deep forests, or roam over sandy plains; float on the rivers \nand lakes; feed on the eels and small fish; wing their flight in regular order and then \nstop; and be free and at ease in their resting-places. It was a distress to that bird \nto hear men speak; what did it care for all the noise and hubbub made about it? If the \nmusic of the Kiû-shâo \nor the Hsien-khih \nwere performed in the wild of the Thung-thing \nlake, birds would fly away, and beasts would run off when they heard it, and fishes would \ndive down to the bottom of the water; while men, when they hear it, would come all round \ntogether,\n\nand look on. Fishes live and men die in the water. They are different in constitution, \nand therefore differ in their likes and dislikes. Hence it was that the ancient sages \ndid not require (from all) the same ability, nor demand the same performances. They gave \nnames according to the reality of what was done, and gave their approbation where it was \nspecially suitable. This was what was called the method of universal adaptation and of \nsure success.'\n\n6. Lieh-dze (once) upon a journey took a meal by the road-side. There he saw a skull a \nhundred years old, and, pulling away the bush (under which it lay), he pointed to it and \nsaid, 'It is only you and I who know that you are not dead, and that (aforetime) you were \nnot alive. Do you indeed really find (in death) the nourishment (which you like)? Do I \nreally find (in life my proper) enjoyment? The seeds (of things) are multitudinous and \nminute. On the surface of the water they form a membranous texture. When they reach to \nwhere the land and water join they become the (lichens which we call the) clothes of frogs \nand oysters. Coming to life on mounds and heights, they become the plantain; and, receiving \nmanure, appear as crows' feet. The roots of the crow's foot become grubs, and its leaves, \nbutterflies. This butterfly, known by the name of hsü, is changed into an insect, and \ncomes to life under a furnace. Then it has the form of a moth, and is named the khü-to. \nThe khü-to after a thousand days becomes a bird, called the kan-yü-kû. Its saliva becomes \nthe sze-mî, and this again the shih-hsî (or pickle-eater). The î-lo is produced from the \npickle-eater; the hwang-kwang from the\n\nkiû-yû; the mâu-zui from the pû-khwan. The ying-hsî uniting with a bamboo, which has long \nceased to put forth sprouts, produces the khing-ning; the khing-ning, the panther; the \npanther, the horse; and the horse, the man. Man then again enters into the great Machinery \n(of Evolution), from which all things come forth (at birth), and which they enter at death.'\n"

    "BOOK XIX. TÂ SHÄNG.": "\n1. He who understands the conditions of Life does not strive after what is of no use to \nlife; and he who understands the conditions of Destiny does not strive after what is beyond \nthe reach of knowledge. In nourishing the body it is necessary to have beforehand the \nthings (appropriate to its support); but there are cases where there is a superabundance \nof such things, and yet the body is not nourished'. In order to have life it is necessary \nthat it do not have left the body; but there are cases when the body has not been left \nby it, and yet the life has perished.\n\nWhen life comes, it cannot be declined; when it goes, it cannot be detained. Alas! the \nmen of the world think that to nourish the body is sufficient to preserve life; and when \nsuch nourishment is not sufficient to preserve the life, what can be done in the world \nthat will be sufficient? Though (all that men can do) will be insufficient, yet there \nare things which they feel they ought to do, and they do not try to avoid doing them. \nFor those who wish to\n\navoid caring for the body, their best plan is to abandon the world. Abandoning the world, \nthey are free from its entanglements. Free from its entanglements, their (minds) are correct \nand their (temperament) is equable. Thus correct and equable, they succeed in securing \na renewal of life, as some have done. In securing a renewal of life, they are not far \nfrom the True (Secret of their being). But how is it sufficient to abandon worldly affairs? \nand how is it sufficient to forget the (business of) life? Through the renouncing of (worldly) \naffairs, the body has no more toil; through forgetting the (business of) life, the vital \npower suffers no diminution. When the body is completed and the vital power is restored \n(to its original vigour), the man is one with Heaven. Heaven and Earth are the father \nand mother of all things. It is by their union that the body is formed; it is by their \nseparation that a (new) beginning is brought about. When the body and vital power suffer \nno diminution, we have what may be called the transference of power. From the vital force \nthere comes another more vital, and man returns to be the assistant of Heaven.\n\n2. My master Lieh-dze asked Yin, (the warden) of the gate, saying, 'The perfect man walks under\n\nwater without encountering any obstruction, treads on fire without being burned, and walks \non high above all things without any fear; let me ask how he attains to do this?' The \nwarden Yin replied, 'It is by his keeping of the pure breath (of life); it is not to be \ndescribed as an achievement of his skill or daring. Sit down, and I will explain it to \nyou. Whatever has form, semblance, sound, and colour is a thing; how can one thing come \nto be different from another? But it is not competent for any of these things to reach \nto what preceded them all;—they are but (form and) visibility. But (the perfect man) \nattains to be (as it were) without form, and beyond the capability of being transformed. \nNow when one attains to this and carries it out to the highest degree, how can other things \ncome into his way to stop him? He will occupy the place assigned to him without going \nbeyond it, and lie concealed in the clue which has no end. He will study with delight \nthe process which gives their beginning and ending to all things. By gathering his nature \ninto a unity, by nourishing his vital power, by concentrating his virtue, lie will penetrate \nto the making of things. In this condition, with his heavenly constitution kept entire, \nand with no crevice in his spirit, how can things enter (and disturb his serenity)?\n\n'Take the case of a drunken man falling from his carriage;—though he may suffer injury, \nhe will not\n\ndie. His bones and joints are the same as those of other men, but the injury which he \nreceives is different:—his spirit is entire. He knew nothing about his getting into \nthe carriage, and knew nothing about his falling from it. The thought of death or life, \nor of any alarm or affright, does not enter his breast; and therefore he encounters danger \nwithout any shrinking from it. Completely under the influence of the liquor he has drunk, \nit is thus with him;—how much more would it be so, if he were under the influence \nof his Heavenly constitution! The sagely man is kept hid in his Heavenly constitution, \nand therefore nothing can injure him.\n\n'A man in the pursuit of vengeance would not break the (sword) Mo-yê or Yü-kiang (which \nhad done the deed); nor would one, however easily made wrathful, wreak his resentment \non the fallen brick. In this way all under heaven there would be peace, without the disorder \nof assaults and fighting, without the punishments of death and slaughter:—such would \nbe the issue of the course (which I have described). If the disposition that is of human \norigin be not developed, but that which is the gift of Heaven, the development of the \nlatter will produce goodness, while that of the former would produce hurt. If the latter \nwere not wearied of, and the former not slighted, the people would be brought nearly to \ntheir True nature.'\n\n3. When Kung-nî was on his way to Khû, as he issued from a forest, he saw a hunchback \nreceiving cicadas (on the point of a rod), as if he were picking them up with his hand. \n'You are clever!' said he\n\nto the man. 'Is there any method in it?' The hunchback replied, 'There is. For five or \nsix months, I practised with two pellets, till they never fell down, and then I only failed \nwith a small fraction of \nthe cicadas (which I tried to catch). Having succeeded in \nthe same way with three (pellets), I missed only one cicada in ten. Having succeeded with \nfive, I caught the cicadas as if I were gathering them. My body is to me no more than \nthe stump of a broken trunk, and my shoulder no more than the branch of a rotten tree. \nGreat as heaven and earth are, and multitudinous as things are, I take no notice of them, \nbut only of the wings of my cicadas; neither turning nor inclining to one side. I would \nnot for them all exchange the wings of my cicadas;—how should I not succeed in taking \nthem?' Confucius looked round, and said to his disciples, \"Where the will is not diverted \nfrom its object, the spirit is concentrated;\"—this might have been spoken of this \nhunchback gentleman.'\n\n4. Yen Yüan asked Kung-nî, saying, 'When 1 was crossing the gulf of Khang-shän, the \nferryman handled the boat like a spirit. I asked him whether such management of a boat \ncould be learned, and he replied, \"It may. Good swimmers can learn it quickly; but as \nfor divers, without having seen a boat, they can manage it at once.\" He did not\n\ndirectly tell me what I asked;—I venture to ask you what he meant.' Kung-nî replied, \n'Good swimmers acquire the ability quickly;—they forget the water (and its dangers). \nAs to those who are able to dive, and without having seen a boat are able to manage it \nat once, they look on the watery gulf as if it were a hill-side, and the upsetting of \na boat as the going back of a carriage. Such upsettings and goings back have occurred \nbefore them multitudes of times, and have not seriously affected their minds. Wherever \nthey go, they feel at ease on their occurrence.\n\n'He who is contending for a piece of earthenware puts forth all his skill. If the prize \nbe a buckle of brass, he shoots timorously; if it be for an article of gold, he shoots \nas if he were blind. The skill of the archer is the same in all the cases; but (in the \ntwo latter cases) he is under the influence of solicitude, and looks on the external prize \nas most important. All who attach importance to what is external show stupidity in themselves.'\n\n5. Thien Khâi-kih was \nhaving an interview with duke Wei of Kâu, who said to him, \n'I have heard that (your master) Kû Hsin has \nstudied the subject of Life. What have \nyou, good Sir, heard from him about it in your intercourse with him?' Thien Khâi-kih replied, \n'In my waiting on him in the courtyard with my broom, what should I have heard from my \nmaster?' Duke Wei said, 'Do not put the question off, Mr. Thien; I wish to hear what\n\nyou have to say.' Khâi-kih then replied, 'I have heard my master say that they who skilfully \nnourish their life are like shepherds, who whip up the sheep that they see lagging behind.' \n'What did he mean?' asked the duke. The reply was, 'In Lû there was a Shan Pâo, who lived \namong the rocks, and drank only water. He would not share with the people in their toils \nand the benefits springing from them; and though he was now in his seventieth year, he \nhad still the complexion of a child. Unfortunately he encountered a hungry tiger, which \nkilled and ate him. There was also a Kang Î, who hung up a screen at his lofty door, and \nto whom all the people hurried (to pay their respects). In his fortieth year, he fell \nill of a fever and died. (Of these two men), Pho nourished his inner man, and a tiger \nate his outer; while I nourished his outer man, and disease attacked his inner. Both of \nthem neglected whipping up their lagging sheep.'\n\nKung-nî said, 'A man should not retire and hide himself; he should not push forward and \ndisplay himself; he should be like the decayed tree which stands in the centre of the \nground. Where these three conditions are fulfilled, the name will reach its greatest height. \nWhen people fear the dangers of a path, if one man in ten be killed, then fathers and \nsons, elder brothers and younger, warn one another that they must not go out on a journey \nwithout a large number of retainers;—and is it not a mark of wisdom to do so? But \nthere are dangers which\n\nmen incur on the mats of their beds, and in eating and drinking; and when no warning is \ngiven against them;—is it not a mark of error?'\n\n6. The officer of Prayer \nin his dark and square-cut robes goes to the pig-pen, and \nthus counsels the pigs, 'Why should you shrink from dying? I will for three months feed \nyou on grain. Then for ten days I will fast, and keep vigil for three days, after which \nI will put down the mats of white grass, and lay your shoulders and rumps on the carved \nstand;—will not this suit you?' If he had spoken from the standpoint of the pigs, \nhe would have said, 'The better plan will be to feed us with our bran and chaff, and leave \nus in our pen.' When consulting for himself, he preferred to enjoy, while he lived, his \ncarriage and cap of office, and after death to be borne to the grave on the ornamented \ncarriage, with the canopy over his coffin. Consulting for the pigs, he did not think of \nthese things, but for himself he would have chosen them. Why did he think so differently \n(for himself and) for the pigs?\n\n7. (Once), when duke Hwan \nwas hunting by a marsh, with Kwan Kung driving the carriage, he saw a ghost. Laying his hand on that of Kwan\n\nKung, he said to him, 'Do you see anything, Father Kung?' 'Your servant sees nothing,' \nwas the reply. The duke then returned, talking incoherently and becoming ill, so that \nfor several days he did not go out. Among the officers of Khî there was a Hwang-dze Kâo-âo, \nwho said to the duke, 'Your Grace is injuring yourself; how could a ghost injure you? \nWhen a paroxysm of irritation is dispersed, and the breath does not return (to the body), \nwhat remains in the body is not sufficient for its wants. When it ascends and does not \ndescend, the patient becomes accessible to gusts of anger. When it descends and does not \nascend, he loses his memory of things. When it neither ascends nor descends, but remains \nabout the heart in the centre of the body, it makes him ill.' The duke said, 'Yes, but \nare there ghostly sprites?' \nThe officer replied, 'There are about mountain tarns there \nis the Lî; about furnaces, the Khieh; about the dust-heaps inside the door, the Lei-thing. \nIn low-lying places in the north-east, the Pei-a and Wa-lung leap about, and in similar \nplaces in the north-west there dwells the Yî-yang. About rivers there is the Wang-hsiang; \nabout mounds, the Hsin; about hills, the Khwei; about wilds, the Fang-hwang; about marshes, \nthe Wei-tho.' 'Let me ask what is the Wei-tho like?' asked the duke. Hwang-dze said, 'It \nis the size of the\n\nnave of a chariot wheel, and the length of the shaft. It wears a purple robe and a red \ncap. It dislikes the rumbling noise of chariot wheels, and, when it hears it, it puts \nboth its hands to its head and stands up. He who sees it is likely to become the leader \nof all the other princes.' Duke Hwan burst out laughing and said, 'This was what I saw.' \nOn this he put his robes and cap to rights, and made Hwang-dze sit with him. Before the \nday was done, his illness was quite gone, he knew not how.\n\n8. Kî Hsing-dze was rearing a fighting-cock for the king. Being asked after ten days \nif the bird were ready, he said, 'Not yet; he is still vain and quarrelsome, and relies \non his own vigour.' Being asked the same after other ten days, he said, 'Not yet; he still \nresponds to the crow and the appearance of another bird.' After ten days more, he replied, \n'Not yet. He still looks angrily, and is full of spirit.' When a fourth ten days had passed, \nhe replied to the question, 'Nearly so. Though another cock crows, it makes no change \nin him. To look at him, you would say he was a cock of wood. His quality is complete. \nNo other cock will dare to meet him, but will run from him.'\n\n9. Confucius was looking at the cataract near the gorge of Lü, which fell a height of 240 cubits, and\n\nthe spray of which floated a distance of forty lî, (producing a turbulence) in which no \ntortoise, gavial, fish, or turtle could play. He saw, however, an old man swimming about \nin it, as if he had sustained Some great calamity, and wished to end his life. Confucius \nmade his disciples hasten along the stream to rescue the man; and by the time they had \ngone several hundred paces, he was walking along singing, with his hair dishevelled, and \nenjoying himself at the foot of the embankment. Confucius followed and asked him, saying, \n'I thought you were a sprite; but, when I look closely at you, I see that you are a man. \nLet me ask if you have any particular way of treading the water.' The man said, 'No, I \nhave no particular way. I began (to learn the art) at the very earliest time; as I grew \nup, it became my nature to practise it; and my success in it is now as sure as fate. I \nenter and go down with the water in the very centre of its whirl, and come up again with \nit when it whirls the other way. I follow the way of the water, and do nothing contrary \nto it of myself;—this is how I tread it.' Confucius said, 'What do you mean by saying \nthat you began to learn the art at the very earliest time; that as you grew up, it became \nyour nature to practise it, and that your success in it now is as sure as fate?' The man \nreplied, 'I was born among these hills and lived contented among them;—that was why \nI say that I have trod this water from my earliest time. I grew up by it, and have been \nhappy treading it;—that is why I said that to tread it had become natural to me. \nI know not how I do it, and yet I do it;—that is why I say that my success is as \nsure as fate.'\n\n10. Khing, the Worker in Rottlera wood, carved a bell-stand, and when it was completed, \nall who saw it were astonished as if it were the work of spirits. The marquis of Lû went \nto see it, and asked by what art he had succeeded in producing it. 'Your subject is but \na mechanic,' was the reply; 'what art should I be possessed of? Nevertheless, there is \none thing (which I will mention), When your servant had undertaken to make the bell-stand, \nI did not venture to waste any of my power, and felt it necessary to fast in order to \ncompose my mind. After fasting for three days, I did not presume to think of any congratulation, \nreward, rank, or emolument (which I might obtain by the execution of my task); after fasting \nfive days, I did not presume to think of the condemnation or commendation (which it would \nproduce), or of the skill or want of skill (which it might display). At the end of the \nseven days, I had forgotten all about myself;—my four limbs and my whole person. \nBy this time the thought of your Grace's court (for which I was to make the thing) had \npassed away; everything that could divert my mind from exclusive devotion to the exercise \nof my skill had disappeared. Then I went into the forest, and looked at the natural forms \nof the trees. When I saw one of a perfect form, then the figure of the bell-stand rose \nup to my view, and I applied my hand to the work. Had\n\nI not met with such a tree, I must have abandoned the object; but my Heaven-given faculty \nand the Heaven-given qualities of the wood were concentrated on it. So it was that my \nspirit was thus engaged in the production of the bell-stand.'\n\n11. Tung-yê Kî was \nintroduced to duke Kwang \nto exhibit his driving. His horses went \nforwards and backwards with the straightness of a line, and wheeled to the right and the \nleft with the exactness of a circle. The duke thought that the lines and circles could \nnot be surpassed if they were woven with silken strings, and told him to make a hundred \ncircuits on the same lines. On the road Yen Ho met the equipage, and on entering (the \npalace), and seeing the duke, he said, 'Kî's horses will break down,' but the duke was \nsilent, and gave him no reply. After a little the horses did come back, having broken \ndown; and the duke then said,' How did you know that it would be so?' Yen Ho said, 'The \nhorses were exhausted, and he was still urging them on. It was this which made me say \nthat they would break down.'\n\n12. The artisan Shui \nmade things round (and square) more exactly than if he had used \nthe circle\n\nand square. The operation of his fingers on (the forms of) things was like the transformations \nof them (in nature), and required no application of his mind; and so his Intelligence \nI was entire and encountered no resistance.\n\n13. To be unthought of by the foot that wears it is the fitness of a shoe; to be unthought \nof by the waist is the fitness of a girdle. When one's wisdom does not think of the right \nor the wrong (of a question under discussion), that shows the suitability of the mind \n(for the question); when one is conscious of no inward change, or outward attraction, \nthat shows the mastery of affairs. He who perceives at once the fitness, and never loses \nthe sense of it, has the fitness that forgets all about what is fitting.\n\n14. There was a Sun Hsiû \nwho went to the door of Dze-pien Khing-dze, and said to him \nin a strange perturbed way, 'When I lived in my village, no one took notice of me, but \nall said that I did not cultivate (my fields); in a time of trouble and attack, no one \ntook notice of me, but all said that I had no courage. But that I did not cultivate my \nfields, was really because I never met with a good year; and that I did not do service \nfor our ruler, was because I did not meet with the suitable opportunity to do so. I have \nbeen sent about my business by the villagers, and am driven away by the registrars of \nthe district;—what is my crime? O Heaven! how is it that I have met with such a fate?'\n\nPien-dze said to him, \n'Have you not heard how the perfect man deals with himself? He \nforgets that be has a liver and gall. He takes no thought of his ears and eyes. He seems \nlost and aimless beyond the dust and dirt of the world, and enjoys himself at ease in \noccupations untroubled by the affairs of business. He may be described as acting and yet \nnot relying on what he does, as being superior and yet not using his superiority to exercise \nany control. But now you would make a display of your wisdom to astonish the ignorant; \nyou would cultivate your person to make the inferiority of others more apparent; you seek \nto shine as if you were carrying the sun and moon in your hands. That you are complete \nin your bodily frame, and possess all its nine openings; that you have not met with any \ncalamity in the middle of your course, such as deafness, blindness, or lameness, and can \nstill take your place as a man among other men;—in all this you are fortunate. What \nleisure have you to murmur against Heaven? Go away, Sir.'\n\nSun-dze on this went out, and Pien-dze went inside. Having sitten down, after a little \ntime he looked up to heaven, and sighed. His disciples asked him why he sighed, and he \nsaid to them, 'Hsiû came to me a little while ago, and I told him the characteristics \nof the perfect man. I am afraid he will be frightened, and get into a state of perplexity.' \nHis disciples said, 'Not so. If what he said was right, and what you\n\nsaid was wrong, the wrong will certainly not be able to perplex the right. If what he \nsaid was wrong, and what you said was right, it was just because he was perplexed that \nhe came to you. What was your fault in dealing with him as you did?' Pien-dze said, 'Not \nso. Formerly a bird came, and took up its seat in the suburbs of Lû. The ruler of Lû \nwas pleased with it, and provided an ox, a sheep, and a pig to feast it, causing also \nthe Kiû-shâo to be performed to delight it. But the bird began to be sad, looked dazed, \nand did not venture to eat or drink. This was what is called \"Nourishing a bird, as you \nwould nourish yourself.\" He who would nourish a bird as a bird should be nourished should \nlet it perch in a deep forest, or let it float on a river or lake, or let it find its \nfood naturally and undisturbed on the level dry ground. Now Hsiû (came to me), a man of \nslender intelligence, and slight information, and I told him of the characteristics of \nthe perfect man, it was like using a carriage and horses to convey a mouse, or trying \nto delight a quail with the music of bells and drums;could the creatures help being frightened?'\n"

    "BOOK XX. SHAN MÛ.": "\n1. Kwang-dze was walking on a mountain, when he saw a great tree with huge branches \nand luxuriant foliage. A wood-cutter was resting by its side, but he would not touch it, \nand, when asked the reason, said, that it was of no use for anything, Kwang-dze then said \nto his disciples, 'This tree, because its wood is good for nothing, will succeed in living \nout its natural term of years.' Having left the mountain, the Master lodged in the house \nof an old friend, who was glad to see him, and ordered his waiting-lad to kill a goose \nand boil it. The lad said, 'One of our geese can cackle, and the other cannot;—which \nof them shall I kill?' The host said, 'Kill the one that cannot cackle.'\n\nNext day, his disciples asked Kwang-dze, saying, 'Yesterday the tree on the mountain (you \nsaid) would live out its years because of the uselessness of its wood, and now our host's \ngoose has died because of its want of power (to cackle);—which of these conditions, \nMaster, would you prefer to be in?' Kwang-dze laughed and said, '(If I said that) I would \nprefer to be in a position between being fit to be useful and wanting that fitness, that \nwould\n\nseem to be the right position, but it would not be so, for it would not put me beyond \nbeing involved in trouble; whereas one who takes his seat on the Tâo and its Attributes, \nand there finds his ease and enjoyment, is not exposed to such a contingency. He is above \nthe reach both of praise and of detraction; now he (mounts aloft) like a dragon, now he \n(keeps beneath) like a snake; he is transformed with the (changing) character of the time, \nand is not willing to addict himself to any one thing; now in a high position and now \nin a low, he is in harmony with all his surroundings; he enjoys himself at case with the \nAuthor of all things; \nhe treats things as things, and is not a thing to them:—where \nis his liability to be involved in trouble? This was the method of Shän Näng and Hwang-Tî. \nAs to those who occupy themselves with the qualities of things, and with the teaching \nand practice of the human relations, it is not so with them. Union brings on separation; \nsuccess, overthrow; sharp corners, the use of the file; honour, critical remarks; active \nexertion, failure; wisdom, scheming; inferiority, being despised:—where is the possibility \nof unchangeableness in any of these conditions? Remember this, my disciples. Let your \nabode be here,-in the Tâo and its Attribute.'\n\n2. Î-liâo, an officer of \nShih-nan, having an interview\n\nwith the marquis of Lû, \nfound him looking sad, and asked him why he was so. The marquis \nsaid, 'I have studied the ways of the former kings, and cultivated the inheritance left \nme by my predecessors. I reverence the spirits of the departed and honour the men of worth, \ndoing this with personal devotion, and without the slightest intermission. Notwithstanding, \nI do not avoid meeting with calamity, and this it is which makes me sad.' The officer \nsaid, 'The arts by which you try to remove calamity are shallow. Think of the close-furred \nfox and of the elegantly-spotted leopard. They lodge in the forests on the hills, and \nlurk in their holes among the rocks;—keeping still. At night they go about, and during \nday remain in their lairs; so cautious are they. Even if they are suffering from hunger, \nthirst, and other distresses, they still keep aloof from men, seeking their food about \nthe Kiang and the Ho;—so resolute are they. Still they are not able to escape the \ndanger of the net or the trap; and what fault is it of theirs? It is their skins which \noccasion them the calamity.\n\n'And is not the state of Kû your lordship's skin? I wish your lordship to rip your skin \nfrom your body, to cleanse your heart, to put away your desires, and to enjoy yourself \nwhere you will be\n\nwithout the presence of any one. In the southern state of Yüeh, there is a district called \n\"the State of Established Virtue.\" The people are ignorant and simple; their object is \nto minimise the thought of self and make their desires few; they labour but do not lay \nup their gains; they give but do not seek for any return; they do not know what righteousness \nis required of them in any particular case, nor by what ceremonies their performances \nshould be signalised; acting in a wild and eccentric way as if they were mad, they yet \nkeep to the grand rules of conduct. Their birth is an occasion for joy; their death is \nfollowed by the rites of burial. I should wish your lordship to leave your state; to give \nup your ordinary ways, and to proceed to that country by the directest course.'\n\nThe ruler said, 'The way to it is distant and difficult; there are rivers and hills; and \nas I have neither boat nor carriage, how am I to go?' The officer from Shih-nan rejoined, \n'If your lordship abjure your personal state, and give up your wish to remain here, that \nwill serve you for a carriage.' The ruler rejoined, 'The way to it is solitary and distant, \nand there are no people on it;—whom shall 1 have as my companions? I have no provisions \nprepared, and how shall I get food?-how shall I be able to get (to the country)?' The \nofficer said, 'Minimise your lordship's expenditure, and make your wants few, and though \nyou have no provisions prepared, you will find you have enough. Wade through the rivers \nand float along on the sea, where however you look, you see not the shore, and, the farther \nyou go, you do not see where your journey is to end;—those who escorted you to the \nshore will\n\nreturn, and after that you will feel yourself far away. Thus it is that he who owns men \n(as their ruler) is involved in troubles, and he who is owned by men (as their ruler) \nsuffers from sadness; and hence Yâo would neither own men, nor be owned by them. I wish \nto remove your trouble, and take away your sadness, and it is only (to be done by inducing \nyou) to enjoy yourself with the Tâo in the land of Great Vacuity.\n\n'If a man is crossing a river in a boat, and another empty vessel comes into collision \nwith it, even though he be a man of a choleric temper, he will not be angry with it. If \nthere be a person, however, in that boat, he will bawl out to him to haul out of the way. \nIf his shout be not heard, he will repeat it; and if the other do not then hear, he will \ncall out a third time, following up the shout with abusive terms. Formerly he was not \nangry, but now he is; formerly (he thought) the boat was empty, but now there is a person \nin it. If a man can empty himself of himself, during his time in the world, who can harm \nhim?'\n\n3. Pei-kung Shê was \ncollecting taxes for duke Ling of Wei, to be employed in making \n(a peal of) bells. (In connexion with the work) he built an altar outside the gate of \nthe suburban wall; and in three months the bells were completed, even to the suspending \nof the upper and lower (tiers). The king's son Khing-kî saw them, and asked what\n\narts he had employed in the making of them. Shê replied, 'Besides my undivided attention \nto them, 1 did not venture to use any arts. I have heard the saying, \"After all the carving \nand the chiselling, let the object be to return to simplicity.\" I was as a child who has \nno knowledge; I was extraordinarily slow and hesitating; they grew like the springing \nplants of themselves. In escorting those who went and meeting those who came, my object \nwas neither to hinder the corners nor detain the goers. I suffered those who strongly \nopposed to take their way, and accepted those who did their best to come to terms. I allowed \nthem all to do the utmost they could, and in this way morning and evening I collected \nthe taxes. I did not have the slightest trouble, and how much more will this be the case \nwith those who pursue the Great Way (on a grand scale)!'\n\n4. Confucius was kept (by his enemies) in a state of siege between Khän and Zhâi, and \nfor seven days had no food cooked with fire to eat. The Thâi-kung Zân went to condole \nwith him, and said, 'You had nearly met with your death.' 'Yes,' was the reply. 'Do you \ndislike death?' 'I do.' Then Zän continued, 'Let me try and describe a way by which (such \na) death may be avoided.—In the eastern sea there are birds which go by the name \nOf Î-îs; they \nfly low and slowly as if they were deficient in power. They fly as if they were\n\nleading and assisting one another, and they press on one another when they roost. No one \nventures to take the lead in going forward, or to be the last in going backwards. In eating \nno one ventures to take the first mouthful, but prefers the fragments left by others. \nIn this way (the breaks in) their line are not many, and men outside them cannot harm them, so that \nthey escape injury.\n\n'The straight tree is the first to be cut down; the well of sweet water is the first to \nbe exhausted. Your aim is to embellish your wisdom so as to startle the ignorant, and \nto cultivate your person to show the unsightliness of others. A light shines around you \nas if you were carrying with you the sun and moon, and thus it is that you do not escape \nsuch calamity. Formerly I heard a highly accomplished man say, \"Those who boast have no \nmerit. The merit which is deemed complete will begin to decay. The fame which is deemed \ncomplete will begin to wane.\" Who can rid himself of (the ideas of) merit and fame, and \nreturn and put himself on the level of the masses of men? The practice of the Tâo flows \nabroad, but its master does not care to dwell where it can be seen; his attainments in \nit hold their course, but he does not wish to appear in its display. Always simple and \ncommonplace, he may seem to be \"bereft of reason. He obliterates the traces of his action, \ngives up position and power, and aims not at merit and fame. Therefore he does not censure \nmen, and men do not censure him. The perfect man does not seek to be heard of; how is \nit that you delight in doing so\n\nConfucius said, 'Excellent;' and thereupon he took leave of his associates, forsook his \ndisciples, retired to the neighbourhood of a great marsh, wore skins and hair cloth, and \nate acorns and chestnuts. He went among animals without causing any confusion among their \nherds, and among birds without troubling their movements. Birds and beasts did not dislike \nhim; how much less would men do so!\n\n5. Confucius asked Dze-sang Hû, \nsaying, 'I was twice driven from Lû; the tree was felled \nover me in Sung; I was obliged to disappear from Wei; I was reduced to extreme distress \nin Shang and Kâu; \nand I was kept in a state of siege between Khän and Zhâi. I have \nencountered these various calamities; my intimate associates are removed from me more \nand more; my followers and friends are more and more dispersed;—why have all these \nthings befallen me?' Dze-sang Hû replied, 'Have you not heard of the flight of Lin Hui \nof Kiâ;—how \nhe abandoned his round jade symbol of rank, worth a thousand pieces \nof silver, and hurried away with his infant son on his back? If it be asked, \"Was it because \nof the market value of the child?\" But that value was small (compared with the value of \nthe jade token). If it be asked again, \"Was it because of the troubles\n\n(of his office)?\" But the child would occasion him much more trouble. Why was it then \nthat, abandoning the jade token, worth a thousand pieces of silver, he hurried away with \nthe child on his back? Lin Hui (himself) said, \"The union between me and the token rested \non the ground of gain; that between me and the child was of Heaven's appointment.\" Where \nthe bond of union is its profitableness, when the pressure of poverty, calamity, distress, \nand injury come, the parties abandon one another; when it is of Heaven's appointment, \nthey hold in the same circumstances to one another. Now between abandoning one another, \nand holding to one another, the difference is great. Moreover, the intercourse of superior \nmen is tasteless as water, while that of mean men is sweet as new wine. But the tastelessness \nof the superior men leads on to affection, and the sweetness of the mean men to aversion. \nThe union which originates without any cause will end in separation without any cause.'\n\nConfucius said, 'I have reverently received your instructions.' And hereupon, with a slow \nstep and an assumed air of ease, he returned to his own house. There he made an end of \nstudying and put away his books. His disciples came no more to make their bow to him (and \nbe taught), but their affection for him increased the more.\n\nAnother day Sang Hû said further to him, 'When Shun was about to die, he charged Yü, saying, 'Be\n\nupon your guard. (The attraction of) the person is not like that of sympathy; the (power \nof) affection is not like the leading (of example). Where there is sympathy, there will \nnot be separation; where there is (the leading of) example, there will be no toil. Where \nthere is neither separation nor toil, you will not have to seek the decoration of forms \nto make the person attractive, and where there is no such need of those forms, there will \ncertainly be none for external things.'\n\n6. Kwang-dze in a patched dress of coarse cloth, and having his shoes tied together with \nstrings, was passing by the king of Wei, who said to him, 'How great, Master, is your \ndistress?' Kwang-dze replied, 'It is poverty, not distress! While a scholar possesses \nthe Tâo and its Attributes, he cannot be going about in distress. Tattered clothes and \nshoes tied on the feet are the sign of poverty, and not of distress. This is what we call \nnot meeting with the right time. Has your majesty not seen the climbing monkey? When he \nis among the plane trees, rottleras, oaks, and camphor trees, he grasps and twists their \nbranches (into a screen), where he reigns quite at his ease, so that not even Î or \nPhäng Mäng could spy him out. \nWhen, however, he finds himself among the prickly mulberry \nand date trees, and other thorns, he goes cautiously, casts sidelong glances, and takes \nevery trembling movement with apprehension;—it is not that his sinews and bones\n\nare straitened, and have lost their suppleness, but the situation is unsuitable for him, \nand he cannot display his agility. And now when I dwell under a benighted ruler, and seditious \nministers, how is it possible for me not to be in distress? My case might afford an illustration \nof the cutting out the heart of Pî-kan!'\n\n7. When Confucius was reduced to great distress between Khän and Khâi, and for seven days \nhe had no cooked food to eat, he laid hold of a decayed tree with his left hand, and with \nhis right hand tapped it with a decayed branch, singing all the while the ode of Piâo-shih \n. He had his instrument, but the notes were not marked on it. There was a noise, but no \nblended melody. The sound of the wood and the voice of the man came together like the \nnoise of the plough through the ground, yet suitably to the feelings of the disciples \naround. Yen Hui, who was standing upright, with his hands crossed on his breast, rolled \nhis eyes round to observe him. Kung-nî, fearing that Hui would go to excess in manifesting \nhow he honoured himself, or be plunged in sorrow through his love for him, said to him, \n'Hui, not to receive (as evils) the inflictions of Heaven is easy; not to receive (as \nbenefits) the favours of men is difficult. There is no beginning which was not an end. \nThe Human and the Heavenly may be one\n\nand the same. Who, for instance, is it that is now singing?' Hui said, 'I venture to \nask how not to receive (as evils) the inflictions of Heaven is easy.' Kung-nî said, 'Hunger, \nthirst, cold, and heat, and having one's progress entirely blocked up;—these are \nthe doings of Heaven and Earth, necessary incidents in the revolutions of things. They \nare occurrences of which we say that we will pass on (composedly) along with them. The \nminister of another does not dare to refuse his commands; and if he who is discharging \nthe duty of a minister feels it necessary to act thus, how much more should we wait with \ncase on the commands of Heaven!'\n\n'What do you mean by saying that not to receive (as benefits) the favours of men is difficult?' \nKung-nî said, 'As soon as one is employed in office, he gets forward in all directions; \nrank and emolument come to him together, and without end. But these advantages do not \ncome from one's self;—it is my appointed lot to have such external good. The superior \nman is not a robber; the man of worth is no filcher;—if I prefer such things, what \nam I? Hence it is \nsaid, \"There is no bird wiser than the swallow.\" Where its eye lights \non a place that is not suitable for it, it does not give it a second glance. Though it \nmay drop the food from its\n\nmouth, it abandons it, and hurries off. It is afraid of men, and yet it stealthily takes \nup its dwelling by his; finding its protection in the altars of the Land and Grain.\n\n'What do you mean by saying that there is no beginning which was not an end?' Kung-nî \nsaid, 'The change—rise and dissolution—of all things (continually) goes on, \nbut we do not know who it is that maintains and continues the process. How do we know \nwhen any one begins? How do we know when he will end? We have simply to wait for it, and \nnothing more.'\n\n'And what do you mean by saying that the Human and the Heavenly are one and the same?' \nKung-nî said, 'Given man, and you have Heaven; given Heaven, and you still have Heaven \n(and nothing more). That man can not have Heaven is owing to the limitation of his nature. \nThe sagely man quietly passes away with his body, and there is an end of it.'\n\n8. As Kwang Kâu was rambling in the park of Tiâo-ling he saw a strange bird which came from the south. \nIts wings were seven cubits in width, and\n\nits eyes were large, an inch in circuit. It touched the forehead of Kâu as it passed him, \nand lighted in a grove of chestnut trees. 'What bird is this?' said he, 'with such great \nwings not to go on! and with such large eyes not to see me!' He lifted up his skirts, \nand hurried with his cross-bow, waiting for (an opportunity to shoot) it. (Meanwhile) \nhe saw a cicada, which had just alighted in a beautiful shady spot, and forgot its (care \nfor its) body. (just then), a preying mantis raised its feelers, and pounced on the cicada, \nin its eagerness for its prey, (also) forgetting (its care for) its body; while the strange \nbird took advantage of its opportunity to secure them both, in view of that gain forgetting \nits true (instinct of preservation). Kwang Kâu with an emotion of pity, said, 'Ah! \nso it is that things bring evil on one another, each of these creatures invited its own \ncalamity.' (With this) he put away his cross-bow, and was hurrying away back, when the \nforester pursued him with terms of reproach.\n\nWhen he returned and went into his house, he did not appear in his courtyard for three \nmonths. (When he came out), Lan Zü (his disciple) \nasked him, saying, 'Master, why \nhave you for this some time avoided the courtyard so much?' Kwang-dze replied, 'I was \nguarding my person, and forgot myself; I was looking at turbid water, till I\n\nmistook the clear pool. And moreover I have heard the Master say, \"Going where certain \ncustoms prevail, you should follow those customs.\" I was walking about in the park of \nTiâo-ling, and forgot myself. A strange bird brushed past my forehead, and went flying \nabout in the grove of chestnuts, where it forgot the true (art of preserving itself). \nThe forester of the chestnut grove thought that I was a fitting object for his reproach. \nThese are the reasons why I have avoided the courtyard.'\n\n9. Yang-dze, having gone to Sung, passed the night in a lodging-house, the master of which \nhad two concubines;—one beautiful, the other ugly. The ugly one was honoured, \nhowever, and the beautiful one contemned. Yang-dze asked the reason, and a little boy \nof the house replied, 'The beauty knows her beauty, and we do not recognise it. The ugly \none knows her ugliness, and we do not recognise it.' Yang-dze said, 'Remember it, my disciples. \nAct virtuously, and put away the practice of priding yourselves on your virtue. If you \ndo this, where can you go to that you will not be loved?'\n"

    "BOOK XXI, THIEN DZE-FANG.": "\n1. Thien Dze-fang, sitting in attendance on the marquis Wän of Wei, often quoted (with \napprobation) the words of Khî Kung. The marquis said, 'Is Khî Kung your preceptor?' \nDze-fang replied, 'No. He only belongs to the same neighbourhood. In speaking about the \nTâo, his views are often correct, and therefore I quote them as I do.' The marquis went \non, 'Then have you no preceptor?' 'I have.' And who is he? He is Tung-kwo Shun-dze.' \n'And why, my Master, have I never heard you quote his words?' Dze-fang replied, 'He is \na man who satisfies the true (ideal of humanity); a man in appearance, but (having \nthe mind of) Heaven. Void of any thought of himself, he accommodates himself to others, \nand nourishes the true ideal that belongs to him. With all his purity, he is forbearing \nto others. Where they are without the Tâo, he rectifies his demeanour, so that they understand \nit, and in consequence their own ideas melt\n\naway and disappear. How should one like me be fit to quote his words?'\n\nWhen Dze-fang went out, the marquis Wän continued in a state of dumb amazement all the \nday. He then called Lung Lî-khin, and said to him, 'How far removed from us is the superior \nman of complete virtue! Formerly I thought the words of the sages and wise men, and the \npractice of benevolence and righteousness, to be the utmost we could reach to. Since I \nhave heard about the preceptor of Dze-fang, my body is all unstrung, and I do not wish \nto move, and my mouth is closed up, and I do not wish to speak;—what I have learned \nhas been only a counterfeit of the truth. Yes, (the possession of Wei) has been an \nentanglement to me.'\n\n2. Wän-po Hsüeh-dze, \non his way to Khï, stayed some time in Lû, where some persons \nof the state begged to have an interview with him. He refused them, saying, 'I have heard \nthat the superior men of these Middle States understand the (subjects of) ceremony \nand righteousness, but are deplorably ignorant of the minds of men. I do not wish to see \nthem.' He went on to Khî; and on his way back (to the south), he again stayed in Lû, when \nthe same persons begged as before for an interview. He then said, 'Formerly they asked \nto see me, and now again they seek an interview. They will afford me\n\nsome opportunity of bringing out my sentiments.' He went out accordingly and saw the visitors, \nand came in again with a sigh. Next day the same thing occurred, and his servant said \nto him, 'How is it that whenever you see those visitors, you are sure to come in again \nsighing?' 'I told you before,' was the reply, 'that the people of these Middle States \nunderstand (the subjects of) ceremony and righteousness, but are deplorably ignorant of \nthe minds of men. Those men who have just seen me, as they came in and went out would \ndescribe, one a circle and another a square, and in their easy carriage would be like, \none a dragon and another a tiger. They remonstrated with me as sons (with their fathers), \nand laid down the way for me as fathers (for their sons). It was this which made me sigh.'\n\nKung-nî saw the man, but did not speak a word to him. Dze-lû said, 'You have wished, Sir, \nto see this Wän-po Hsüeh-dze for a long time; what is the reason that when you have seen \nhim, you have not spoken a word?' Kung-nî replied, 'As soon as my eyes lighted on that \nman, the Tâo in him was apparent. The situation did not admit of a word being spoken.'\n\n3. Yen Yüan asked Kung-nî, saying, 'Master, when you pace quietly along, I also pace along; \nwhen you go more quickly, I also do the same; when you gallop, I also gallop; but when \nyou race along and spurn the dust, then I can only stand and look, and keep behind you.' \nThe Master said, 'Hui, what do you mean?' The reply was, 'In saying that when you, Master, \npace quietly along, I also pace\n\nalong,\" I mean that when \nyou speak, I also speak. By saying, \"When you go more quickly, \nI also do the same,\" I mean I that when you reason, I also reason. By saying, \"When you \ngallop, I also gallop,\" I mean that when \nyou speak of the Way, I also speak of the \nWay; but by saying, \"When you race along and spurn the dust, then I can only stare, and \nkeep behind you,\" I am thinking how though you do not speak, yet all men believe you; \nthough you are no partisan, yet all parties approve your catholicity; and though you sound \nno instrument, yet people all move on harmoniously before you, while (all the while) I \ndo not know how all this comes about; and this is all which my words are intended to express.'\n\nKung-nî said, 'But you must try and search the matter out. Of all causes for sorrow there \nis none so great as the death of the mind;—the death of man's (body) is only next \nto it. The sun comes forth in the east, and sets in the extreme West;—all things \nhave their position determined by these two points. All that have eyes and feet wait for \nthis (sun), and then proceed to do what they have to do. When this comes forth, they appear \nin their places; when it sets, they disappear. It is so with all things. They have that \nfor which they wait, and (on its arrival) they die; they have that for which they wait, \nand then (again) they live. When once I receive my frame thus completed, I remain unchanged, \nawaiting the consummation of my course.\n\nI move as acted on by things, day and night without cessation, and I do not know when \nI will come to an end. Clearly I am here a completed frame, and even one who (fancies \nthat he) knows what is appointed cannot determine it beforehand. I am in this way daily \npassing on, but all day long I am communicating my views to you; and now, as we are shoulder \nto shoulder you fail (to understand me);—is it not matter for lamentation? You are \nable in a measure to set forth what I more clearly set forth; but that is passed away, \nand you look for it, as if it were still existing, just as if you were looking for a horse \nin the now empty place where it was formerly exhibited for sale. You have very much forgotten \nmy service to you, and I have very much forgotten wherein I served you. But nevertheless \nwhy should you account this such an evil? What you forget is but my old self; that which \ncannot be forgotten remains with me.'\n\n4. Confucius went to see Lâo Tan, and arrived just as he had completed the bathing of \nhis head, and was letting his dishevelled hair get dry. There be was, motionless, and \nas if there were not another man in the world. Confucius waited quietly; and, when \nin a little time he was introduced, he said, 'Were my eyes dazed? Is it really you? Just \nnow, your body, Sir, was like the stump of a rotten tree. You looked as if you had no \nthought of anything, as if you had left the society of men, and were standing in the solitude \n(of yourself).' Lâo Tan replied, 'I was enjoying myself in thinking about the commencement\n\nof things.' \n'What do you mean?' 'My mind is so cramped, that I hardly know it; my tongue \nis so tied that I cannot tell it; but I will try to describe it to you as nearly as I \ncan. When the state of Yin was perfect, all was cold and severe; when the state of Yang \nwas perfect, all was turbulent and agitated. The coldness and severity came forth from \nHeaven; the turbulence and agitation issued from Earth. The two states communicating together, \na harmony ensued and things were produced. Some one regulated and controlled this, but \nno one has seen his form. Decay and growth; fulness and emptiness; darkness and light; \nthe changes of the sun and the transformations of the moon:—these are brought about \nfrom day to day; but no one sees the process of production. Life has its origin from which \nit springs, and death has its place from which it returns. Beginning and ending go on \nin mutual contrariety without any determinable commencement, and no one knows bow either \ncomes to an end. If we disallow all this, who originates and presides over all these phenomena?'\n\nConfucius said, 'I beg to ask about your enjoyment in these thoughts.' Lâo Tan replied, \n'The\n\ncomprehension of this is the most admirable and the most enjoyable (of all acquisitions). \nThe getting of the most admirable and the exercise of the thoughts in what is the most \nenjoyable, constitutes what we call the Perfect man.' Confucius said, 'I should like to \nhear the method of attaining to it.' The reply was, 'Grass-eating animals do not dislike \nto change their pastures; creatures born in the water do not dislike to change their waters. \nThey make a small change, but do not lose what is the great and regular requirement (of \ntheir nature); joy, anger, sadness, and delight do not enter into their breasts (in connexion \nwith such events). Now the space under the sky is occupied by all things in their unity. \nWhen they possess that unity and equally share it, then the four limbs and hundred members \nof their body are but so much dust and dirt, while death and life, their ending and beginning, \nare but as the succession of day and night, which cannot disturb their enjoyment; and \nhow much less will they be troubled by gains and losses, by calamity and happiness! Those \nwho renounce the paraphernalia of rank do it as if they were casting away so much mud; \nthey know that they are themselves more honourable than those paraphernalia. The honour \nbelonging to one's self is not lost by any change (of condition). Moreover, a myriad transformations \nmay take place before the end of them is reached. What is there in all this sufficient \nto trouble the mind? Those who have attained to the Tâo understand the subject.'\n\nConfucius said, 'O Master, your virtue is equal to that of Heaven and Earth, and still \nI must borrow\n\n(some of your) perfect words (to aid me) in the cultivation of my mind. Who among the \nsuperior men of antiquity could give such expression to them?' Lâo Tan replied, 'Not so. \nLook at the spring, the water of which rises and overflows; it does nothing, but it naturally \nacts so. So with the perfect man and his virtue;—he does not cultivate it, and nothing \nevades its influence. He is like heaven which is high of itself, like earth which is solid \nof itself, like the sun and moon which shine of themselves;—what need is there to \ncultivate it?'\n\nConfucius went out and reported the conversation to Yen Hui, saying, 'In the (knowledge \nof the) Tâo am I any better than an animalcule in vinegar? But for the Master's lifting \nthe veil from me, I should not have known the grand perfection of Heaven and Earth.'\n\n5. At an interview of Kwang-dze with duke Âi of Lû, the duke said, 'There are many \nof the Learned class in Lû; but few of them can be compared with you, Sir.' Kwang-dze \nreplied, 'There are few Learned men in Lû.' 'Everywhere in Lû,' rejoined the duke, 'you \nsee men wearing the dress of the Learned;—how can you say that they are few?' \n'I have heard,' said Kwang-dze, 'that those of them who wear round caps know the times \nof heaven; that those who wear square shoes know the contour of the ground; and that those \nwho saunter about with semicircular stones at their\n\ngirdle-pendents settle matters in dispute as they come before them. But superior men who \nare possessed of such knowledge will not be found wearing the dress, and it does not follow \nthat those who wear the dress possess the knowledge. If your Grace think otherwise, why \nnot issue a notification through the state, that it shall be a capital offence to wear \nthe dress without possessing the knowledge.' On this the duke issued such a notification, \nand in five days, throughout all Lû, there was no one who dared to wear the dress of the \nLearned. There was only one old man who came and stood in it at the duke's gate. The duke \ninstantly called him in, and questioned him about the affairs of the state, when he talked \nabout a thousand points and ten thousand divergences from them. Kwang-dze said, 'When \nthe state of Lû can thus produce but one man of the Learned class, can he be said to be \nmany?'\n\n6. The ideas of rank and emolument did not enter the mind of Pâi-lî Hsî, and so he \nbecame a cattle-feeder, and his cattle were all in fine condition. This made duke Mû of \nKhin forget the meanness of his position, and put the government (of his state) into his \nhands. Neither life nor death entered into the mind of (Shun), the Lord of Yü, and therefore \nhe was able to influence others.\n\n7. The ruler Yüan of \nSung wishing to have a map\n\ndrawn, the masters of the pencil all came (to undertake the task). Having received his \ninstructions and made their bows, they stood, licking their pencils and preparing their \nink. Half their number, however, remained outside. There was one who came late, with an \nair of indifference, and did not hurry forward. When he had received his instructions \nand made his bow, he did not keep standing, but proceeded to his shed. The duke sent a \nman to see him, and there he was, with his upper garment off, sitting cross-legged, and \nnearly naked. The ruler said, 'He is the man; he is a true draughtsman.'\n\n8. King Wän was (once) looking about him at Zang, when he saw an old man fishing. \nBut his fishing was no fishing. It was not the fishing of one whose business is fishing. \nHe was always fishing (as if he had no object in the occupation). The king wished to raise \nhim to office, and put the government into his hands, but was afraid that such a step \nwould give dissatisfaction to his great ministers, his uncles, and cousins. He then wished \nto dismiss the man altogether from his mind, but he could not bear the thought that his \npeople should be without (such a) Heaven (as their Protector). On this, (next) morning, \nhe called together his great officers, and said to them, 'Last night, I dreamt that I \nsaw a good man, with a dark complexion and a\n\nbeard, riding on a piebald horse, one half of whose hoofs were red, who commanded me, \nsaying, \"Lodge your government in the hands of the old man of Zang; and perhaps the evils \nof your people will be cured.\"' The great officers said eagerly, 'It was the king, your \nfather.' King Wän said, 'Let us then submit the proposal to the tortoise-shell.' They \nreplied, 'It is the order of your father. Let not your majesty think of any other. Why \ndivine about it?' (The king) then met the old man of, Zang, and committed the government \nto him. The statutes and laws were not changed by him; not a one-sided order (of his own) \nwas issued; but when the king made a survey of the kingdom after three years, he found \nthat the officers had destroyed the plantations (which harboured banditti), and dispersed \ntheir occupiers, that the superintendents of the official departments did not plume themselves \non their successes, and that no unusual grain measures were allowed within the different \nstates. When the officers \nhad destroyed the dangerous plantations and dispersed their \noccupants, the highest value was set on the common interests; when the chiefs of departments \ndid not plume themselves on their successes, the highest value was set on the common business; \nwhen unusual grain measures did not enter the different states, the different princes \nhad no jealousies. On this king Min made the old man his Grand Preceptor, and asked him, \nwith his own face to the north, whether his government might be extended to all the kingdom. \nThe old\n\nman looked perplexed and gave no reply, but with aimless look took his leave. In the morning \nhe had issued his orders, and at night he had gone his way; nor was he heard of again \nall his life. Yen Yüan questioned Confucius, saying, 'Was even king Wän unequal to determine \nhis course? What had he to do with resorting to a dream?' Kung-nî replied, 'Be silent \nand do not say a word! King Win was complete in everything. What have you to do with criticising \nhim? He only had recourse (to the dream) to meet a moment's difficulty.'\n\n9. Lieh Yü-khâu was exhibiting his archery to Po-hwän Wû-zän. Having drawn the bow \nto its full extent, with a cup of water placed on his elbow, he let fly. As the arrow \nwas discharged, another was put in its place; and as that was sent off, a third was ready \non the string. All the while he stood like a statue. Po-hwän Wû-zän said, 'That is the \nshooting of an archer, but not of one who shoots without thinking about his shooting. \nLet me go up with you to the top of a high mountain, treading with you among the tottering \nrocks, till we arrive at the brink of a precipice, 800 cubits deep, and (I will then see) \nif you can shoot.' On this they went up a high mountain, making their way among the tottering \nrocks, till they came to the brink of a precipice 800 cubits deep. Then Wû-zän turned \nround and walked backwards, till his feet were two-thirds\n\nof their length outside the edge, and beckoned Yü-khâu to come forward. He, however, had \nfallen prostrate on the ground, with the sweat pouring down to his heels. Then the other \nsaid, 'The Perfect man looks up to the azure sky above, or dives down to the yellow springs \nbeneath, or soars away to the eight ends of the universe, without any change coming over \nhis spirit or his breath. But now the trepidation of your mind appears in your dazed eyes; \nyour inward feeling of peril is extreme!'\n\n10. Kien Wû asked Sun-shû Âo, saying, 'You, Sir, were thrice chief minister, and did not \nfeel elated; you were thrice dismissed from that position, without manifesting any sorrow. \nAt first I was in doubt about you, (but I am not now, since) I see how regularly and quietly \nthe breath comes through your nostrils. How is it that you exercise your mind?' Sun-shû \nÂo replied, 'In what do I surpass other men? When the position came to me, I thought it \nshould not be rejected; when it was taken away, I thought it could not be retained. I \nconsidered that the getting or losing it did not make me what I was, and was no occasion \nfor any manifestation of sorrow;—that was all. In what did I surpass other men? And \nmoreover, I did not know whether the honour of it belonged to the dignity, or to myself. \nIf it belonged to the dignity, it was nothing to me; if it belonged to me, it had nothing\n\nto do with the dignity. While occupied with these uncertainties, and looking round in \nall directions, what leisure had I to take knowledge of whether men honoured me or thought \nme mean?'\n\nKung-nî heard of all this, and said, 'The True men of old could not be fully described \nby the wisest, nor be led into excess by the most beautiful, nor be forced by the most \nviolent robber. Neither Fû-hsî nor Hwang-Tî could compel them to be their friends. Death \nand life are indeed great considerations, but they could make no change in their (true) \nself; and how much less could rank and emolument do so? Being such, their spirits might \npass over the Thâi mountain and find it no obstacle to them; they might enter the greatest \ngulphs, and not be wet by them; they might occupy the lowest and smallest positions without \nbeing distressed by them. Theirs was the fulness of heaven and earth; the more that they \ngave to others, the more they had.'\n\nThe king of Khû and the ruler of Fan were sitting together. After a little while, the \nattendants of the king said, 'Fan has been destroyed three times.' The ruler of Fan rejoined, \n'The destruction of Fan has not been sufficient to destroy what we had that was most deserving \nto be preserved.' Now,\n\nif the destruction of Fan had not been sufficient to destroy that which it had most deserving \nto be preserved, the preservation of Khû had not been sufficient to preserve that in it \nmost deserving to be preserved. Looking at the matter from this point of view, Fan had \nnot begun to be destroyed, and Khû had not begun to be preserved.\n"

    "BOOK XXII. KIH PEI YÛ": "1. Knowledgehad rambled \nnorthwards to the region of the Dark Water, where he ascended the height of Imperceptible Slope, when it happened that he met with Dumb Inaction. Knowledge addressed him, saying, 'I wish to ask \nyou some questions:—By what process \nof thought and anxious consideration do we get to know the Tâo? Where should we dwell \nand what should we do to find our rest in the Tâo? From what point should we start and \nwhat path should we pursue to make the Tâo our own?' He asked these three questions, but \nDumb Inactiongave him no reply. \nNot only did he not answer, but he did not know how \nto answer.Knowledge, disappointed by the \nfruitlessness of his questions, returned to the south \nof the Bright\nWater, and ascended \nthe height of the End of Doubtwhere he saw Heedless Blurter, \nto whom he put the same questions, and who replied, 'Ah! I know, and will tell you.' But \nwhile he was about to speak, he forgot what he wanted to say.Knowledge, (again) receiving no answer to his questions, returned to the palace of the \nTî, where he saw \nHwang-Tî, \nand put the questions to him. Hwang-Tî said, 'To exercise \nno thought and no anxious consideration is the first step towards knowing the Tâo; to \ndwell nowhere and do nothing is the first step towards resting in the Tâo; to start from \nnowhere and pursue no path is the first step towards making the Tâo your own.'Knowledge then asked Hwang-Tî, saying, 'I and you know this; those two did not know it; \nwhich of us is right?' The reply was, 'Dumb Inactionis truly right; Heedless Blurter \nhas an appearance of being so; I and you are not near being so. (As it is said), \"Those \nwho know (the Tâo) do not speak of it; those who speak of it do not know it;\" and \"Hence \nthe sage conveys his instructions without the use of speech.\" The Tâo cannot be made \nours by constraint; its characteristics will not come to us (at our call). Benevolence \nmay be practised; Righteousness may be partially attended to; by Ceremonies men impose \non one another. Hence it\nis said, \"When the Tâo was lost, its Characteristics appeared. When its Characteristics \nwere lost, Benevolence appeared. When Benevolence was lost, Righteousness appeared. When \nRighteousness was lost, Ceremonies appeared. Ceremonies are but (the unsubstantial) flowers \nof the Tâo, and the commencement of disorder.\" Hence (also it is further said), \"He \nwho practises the Tâo, daily diminishes his doing. He diminishes it and again diminishes \nit, till he arrives at doing nothing. Having arrived at this non-inaction, there is nothing \nthat he does not do.\" Here now there is something, \na regularly fashioned utensil;—if \nyou wanted to make it return to the original condition of its materials, would it not \nbe difficult to make it do so? Could any but the Great Man accomplish this easily?'Life is the follower of death, and death is the predecessor of life; but who knows the \nArranger (of this connexion between them)? The life is due to the collecting of the \nbreath. When that is collected, there is life; when it is dispersed, there is death. Since \ndeath and life thus attend on each other, why should I account (either of) them an evil?'Therefore all things go through one and the same experience. (Life) is accounted beautiful \nbecause it is spirit-like and wonderful, and death is accounted ugly because of its foetor \nand putridity. But the foetid and putrid is transformed again into the spirit-like and \nwonderful, and the spirit-like and wonderful is transformed again into the foetid and\nputrid. Hence it is said, \"All under the sky there is one breath of life, and therefore \nthe sages prized that unity,\"'Knowledgesaid to \nHwang-Tî, 'I asked Dumb Inaction, and he did not answer me. \nNot only did he not answer me, but he did not know how to answer me. I asked Heedless \nBlurter, and while he wanted to tell me, he yet did not do so. Not only did he not tell \nme, but while he wanted to tell me, he forgot all about my questions. Now I have asked \nyou, and you knew (all about them);—why (do you say that) you are not near doing \nso?' Hwang-Tî replied, 'Dumb Inactionwas truly right, because he did not know the \nthing. Heedless Blurterwas nearly right, \nbecause he forgot it. I and you are not nearly \nright, because we know it.' Heedless Blurterheard of (all this), and considered that Hwang-Tîknew how to express himself (on the subject).2. (The operations of) Heaven and Earth proceed in the most admirable way, but they say \nnothing about them; the four seasons observe the clearest laws, but they do not discuss \nthem; all things have their complete and distinctive constitutions, but they say nothing \nabout them.The sages trace out the admirable operations of Heaven and Earth, and reach to and understand \nthe distinctive constitutions of all things; and thus it is that the Perfect Man (is said \nto) do nothing and the Greatest Sage to originate nothing, such language showing that \nthey look to Heaven and Earth as\ntheir model. Even \nthey, with their spirit-like and most exquisite intelligence, as \nwell as all the tribes that undergo their transformations, the dead and the living, the \nsquare and the round, do not understand their root and origin, but nevertheless they all \nfrom the oldest time by it preserve their being.Vast as is the space included within the six cardinal points, it all (and all that it \ncontains) lies within (this twofold root of Heaven and Earth); small as is an autumn hair, \nit is indebted to this for the completion of its form. All things beneath the sky, now \nrising, now descending, ever continue the same through this. The Yin and Yang, and the \nfour seasons revolve and move by it, each in its proper order. Now it seems to be lost \nin obscurity, but it continues; now it seems to glide away, and have no form, but it is \nstill spirit-like. All things are nourished by it, without their knowing it. This is what \nis called the Root and Origin; by it we may obtain a view of what we mean by Heaven.3, Nieh Khüehasked \nabout the Tâo from Phei-î who replied,' If you keep your body as \nit should be, and look only at the one thing, the Harmony of Heaven will come to you. \nCall in your knowledge, and make your measures uniform, and the spiritual (belonging to \nyou) will come and lodge with you; the Attributes (of the Tâo) will be your beauty, and \nthe Tâo (itself) will be your dwelling-place. You will have the simple look of a new-born \ncalf, and\nwill not seek to know the cause (of your being what you are).' Phei-î had not finished \nthese words when the other dozed off into a sleep.Phei-î was greatly pleased, and walked away, singing as he went,\nLike stump of rotten tree his frame,Like lime when slaked his mind became.Real is his wisdom, solid, true,Nor cares what's hidden to pursue.O dim and dark his aimless mind!No one from him can counsel find.What sort of man is he?'\n4. Shun asked (his attendant) Khäng, \nsaying, 'Can I get the Tâo and hold it as mine?' \nThe reply was, 'Your body is not your own to hold; how then can you get and hold the Tâo?' \nShun resumed, 'If my body be not mine to possess and hold, who holds it?' Khäng said, \n'It is the bodily form entrusted to you by Heaven and Earth. Life is not yours to hold. \nIt is the blended harmony (of the Yin and Yang), entrusted to you by Heaven and Earth. \nYour nature, constituted as it is, is not yours to hold. It is entrusted to you by Heaven \nand Earth to act in accordance with it. Your grandsons and sons are not yours to hold. \nThey are the exuviaeentrusted to you by Heaven and Earth. Therefore when we walk, \nwe should not know where we are going; when we stop and rest, we should not know what \nto occupy ourselves with\nwhen we eat, we should not know the taste of our food;—all is done by the strong \nYang influence of Heaven and Earth. How then can you get (the Tâo), and hold it as \nyour own?'5. Confucius asked Lao Tan, saying, 'Being at leisure to-day, I venture to ask you about \nthe Perfect Tâo.' Lâo Tan replied, 'You must, as by fasting and vigil, clear and purge \nyour mind, wash your spirit white as snow, and sternly repress your knowledge. The subject \nof the Tâo is deep, and difficult to describe;—I will give you an outline of its \nsimplest attributes.'The Luminous was produced from the Obscure; the Multiform from the Unembodied; the Spiritual \nfrom the Tâo; and the bodily from the seminal essence. After this all things produced \none another from their bodily organisations. Thus it is that those which have nine apertures \nare born from the womb, and those with eight from eggs.\nBut their coming leaves no trace, and their going no monument; they enter by no door; \nthey dwell in no apartment:—they are in a vast arena reaching in all directions. \nThey who search for and find (the Tâo) in this are strong in their limbs, sincere and \nfar-reaching in their thinking, acute in their hearing, and clear in their seeing. They \nexercise their minds without being toiled; they respond to everything aright without regard \nto place or circumstance. Without this heaven would not be high, nor earth\nbroad; the sun and moon would not move, and nothing would flourish:—such is the operation \nof the Tâo.'Moreover, the most extensive knowledge does not necessarily know it; reasoning will not \nmake men wise in it;—the sages have decided against both these methods. However you \ntry to add to it, it admits of no increase; however you try to take from it, it admits \nof no diminution;—this is what the sages maintain about it. How deep it is, like \nthe sea! How grand it is, beginning again when it has come to an end! If it carried along \nand sustained all things, without being overburdened or weary, that would be like the \nway of the superior man, merely an external operation; when all things go to it, and find \ntheir dependence in it;—this is the true character of the Tâo.'Here is a man (born) in one of the middle states. He feels himself independent both \nof the Yin and Yang, \nand dwells between heaven and earth; only for the present a mere \nman, but he will return to his original source. Looking at him in his origin, when his \nlife begins, we have (but) a gelatinous substance in which the breath is collecting. Whether \nhis life be long or his death early, how short is the space between them! It is but the \nname for a moment of time, insufficient to play the part of a good Yâo or a bad Kieh in.'The fruits of trees and creeping plants have their distinctive characters, and though \nthe relationships\nof men, according to which they are classified, are troublesome, the sage, when he meets \nwith them, does not set himself in opposition to them, and when he has passed through \nthem, he does not seek to retain them; he responds to them in their regular harmony according \nto his virtue; and even when he accidentally comes across any of them, he does so according \nto the Tâo. It was thus that the Tîs flourished, thus that the kings arose.'Men's life between heaven and earth is like a whitecolt's passing a crevice, and \nsuddenly disappearing. As with a plunge and an effort they all come forth; easily and \nquietly they all enter again. By a transformation they live, and by another transformation \nthey die. Living things are made sad (by death), and mankind grieve for it; but it is \n(only) the removal of the bow from its sheath, and the emptying the natural satchel of \nits contents. There may be some confusion amidst the yielding to the change; but the intellectual \nand animal souls are taking their leave, and the body will follow them:—This is the \nGreat Returning home.'That the bodily frame came from incorporeity, and will return to the same, is what all \nmen in common know, and what those who are on their way to (know) it need not strive for. \nThis is what the multitudes of men discuss together. Those whose (knowledge) is complete \ndo not discuss it;—such discussion shows that their (knowledge) is not complete. \nEven the most clear-sighted do not meet\n(with the Tâo);—it is better to be silent than to reason about it. The Tâo cannot \nbe heard with the ears;—it is better to shut the ears than to try and hear it. This \nis what is called the Great Attainment.'6. Tung-kwo Dzeasked \nKwang-dze, saying, 'Where is what you call the Tâo to be found?' \nKwang-dze replied, 'Everywhere.' The other said, 'Specify an instance of it. That will \nbe more satisfactory.' 'It is here in this ant.' 'Give a lower instance.' 'It is in this \npanic grass.' 'Give me a still lower instance.' 'It is in this earthenware tile.' 'Surely \nthat is the lowest instance?' 'It is in that excrement.' To this Tung-kwo Dze gave \nno reply.Kwang-dze said, 'Your questions, my master, do not touch the fundamental point (of the \nTâo). They remind me of the questions ad-dressed by the superintendents of the market \nto the inspector about examining the value of a pig by treading on it, and testing its \nweight as the foot descends lower and lower on the body. You should not specify any \nparticular thing. There is not a single thing without (the Tâo). So it is with the Perfect \nTâo. And if we call it the Great (Tâo), it is just the same. There are the three terms,—\"Complete,\" \n\"All-embracing,\" \"the Whole.\" These names are different,\nbut the reality (sought in them) is the same referring to the One thing.'Suppose we were to try to roam about in the palace of No-where;—when met there, \nwe might discuss (about the subject) without ever coming to an end. Or suppose we were \nto be together in (the region of) Non-action;—should we say that (the Tâo was) Simplicity \nand Stillness? or Indifference and Purity? or Harmony and Ease? My will would be aimless. \nIf it went nowhere, I should not know where it had got to; if it went and came again, \nI should not know where it had stopped; if it went on going and coming, I should not know \nwhen the process would end. In vague uncertainty should I be in the vastest waste. Though \nI entered it with the greatest knowledge, I should not know how inexhaustible it was. \nThat which makes things what they are has not the limit which belongs to things, and when \nwe speak of things being limited, we mean that they are so in themselves. (The Tâo) is \nthe limit of the unlimited, and the boundlessness of the unbounded.'We speak of fulness and emptiness; of withering and decay. It produces fulness and emptiness, \nbut is neither fulness nor emptiness; it produces withering and decay, but is neither \nwithering nor decay. It produces the root and branches, but is neither root nor branch; \nit produces accumulation and dispersion, but is itself neither accumulated nor dispersed.'7. A-ho Kanand Shän Näng studied together\nunder Läo-lung Kî. Shän Nängwas leaning forward on his stool, having shut the door \nand gone to sleep in the day time. At midday A-ho Kan pushed open the door and entered, \nsaying, 'Lâo-lung is dead.' Shän Näng leant forward on his stool, laid hold of his staff \nand rose. Then he laid the staff aside with a clash, laughed and said, 'That Heaven knew \nhow cramped and mean, how arrogant and assuming I was, and therefore he has cast me off, \nand is dead. Now that there is no Master to correct my heedless words, it is simply for \nme to die!' Yen Kang, (who had come in) to condole, heard these words, and said, 'It is \nto him who embodies the Tâo that the superior men everywhere cling. Now you who do not \nunderstand so much as the tip of an autumn hair of it, not even the ten-thousandth part \nof the Tâo, still know how to keep hidden your heedless words about it and die;—how \nmuch more might he who embodied the Tâo do so! We look for it, and there is no form; we \nhearken for it, and there is no sound. When men try to discuss it, we call them dark indeed. \nWhen they discuss the Tâo, they misrepresent it.'Hereupon Grand Purityasked Infinitude, saying, 'Do you know the Tâo?' 'I do not \nknow it,' was the reply. He then asked Do-nothing,\nWho replied, 'I know it.' 'Is your knowledge of it determined\nby various points?' 'It is.' 'What are they?' Do-nothingsaid, 'I know that the Tâo \nmay be considered noble, and may be considered mean, that it may be bound and compressed, \nand that it may be dispersed and diffused. These are the marks by which I know it.' Grand \nPurity took the words of those two, and asked No-beginning, saying, 'Such were their \nreplies; which was right? and which was wrong? Infinitude's saying that he did not know \nit? or Do-nothing's saying that he knew it?' No-beginning said, 'The \"I do not know it\" \nwas profound, and the \"I know it\" was shallow. The former had reference to its internal \nnature; the latter to its external conditions. Grand Purity looked up and sighed, saying, \n'Is \"not to know it\" then to know it? And is \"to know it\" not to know it? But who knows \nthat he who does not know it (really) knows it?' No-beginning replied, 'The Tâo cannot \nbe heard; what can be heard is not It. The Tâo cannot be seen; what can be seen is not \nIt. The Tâo cannot be expressed in words; what can be expressed in words is not It. Do \nwe know the Formless which gives form to form? In the same way the Tâo does not admit \nof being named.'No-beginning (further) said, 'If one ask about the Tâo and another answer him, neither \nof them knows it. Even the former who asks has never learned anything about the Tâo. He \nasks what does not admit of being asked, and the latter answers where answer is impossible. \nWhen one asks what does not admit of being asked, his questioning is in (dire)\nextremity. When one answers where answer is impossible, he has no internal knowledge of \nthe subject. When people without such internal knowledge wait to be questioned by others \nin dire extremity, they show that externally they see nothing of space and time, and internally \nknow nothing of the Grand Commencement. Therefore they cannot cross over the Khwän-lun, \nnor roam in the Grand Void.'8. Starlightasked Non-entity, saying, 'Master, do you exist? or do you not exist?' \nHe got no answer to his question, however, and looked stedfastly to the appearance of \nthe other, which was that of a deep void. All day long he looked to it, but could see \nnothing; he listened for it, but could hear nothing; he clutched at it, but got hold of \nnothing. \nStarlight then said, 'Perfect! Who can attain to this? I can (conceive the \nideas of) existence and non-existence, but I cannot (conceive the ideas of) non-existing \nnon-existence, and still there be a non-existing existence. How is it possible to reach \nto this?'9. The forger of swords for the Minister of War had reached the age of eighty, and had \nnot lost a hair's-breadth of his ability. The Minister said to\nhim, 'You are indeed skilful, Sir. Have you any method that makes you so?' The man said, \n'Your servant has (always) kept to his work. When I was twenty, I was fond of forging \nswords. I looked at nothing else. I paid no attention to anything but swords. By my constant \npractice of it, I came to be able to do the work without any thought of what I was doing. \nBy length of time one acquires ability at any art; and how much more one who is ever at \nwork on it! What is there which does not depend on this, and succeed by it?'10. Zän Khiûasked \nKung-nî, saying, 'Can it be known how it was before heaven and earth?' \nThe reply was, 'It can. It was the same of old as now.' Zän Khiû asked no more and withdrew. \nNext day, however, he had another interview, and said, 'Yesterday I asked whether it could \nbe known how it was before heaven and earth, and you, Master, said, \"It can. As it is \nnow, so it was of old.\" Yesterday, I seemed to understand you clearly, but to-day it is \ndark to me. I venture to ask you for an explanation of this.' Kung-nî said, 'Yesterday \nyou seemed to understand me clearly, because your own spiritual nature had anticipated \nmy reply. Today it seems dark to you, for you are in an unspiritual mood, and are trying \nto discover the meaning. (In this matter) there is no old time and no present; no beginning \nand no ending. Could it be that there were grandchildren and children before there were \n(other) grandchildren and children?Zän Khiû had not made any reply, when Kung-nî went on, 'Let us have done. There can be \nno answering (on your part). We cannot with life give life to death; we cannot with death \ngive death to life. Do death and life wait (for each other)? There is that which contains \nthem both in its one comprehension. Was that which was produced before Heaven and Earth \na thing? That which made things and gave to each its character was not itself a thing. \nThings came forth and could not be before things, as if there had (previously) been things;—as \nif there had been things (producing one another) without end. The love of the sages for \nothers, and never coming to an end, is an idea taken from this.'11. Yen Yüan asked Kung-nî, saying, 'Master, I have heard you say, \"There should be no \ndemonstration of welcoming; there should be no movement to meet;\"—I venture to ask \nin what way this affection of the mind may be shown.' The reply was, 'The ancients, amid \n(all) external changes, did not change internally; now-a-days men change internally, but \ntake no note of external changes. When one only notes the changes of things, himself continuing \none and the same, he does not change. How should there be (a difference between) his changing \nand not changing? How should he put himself in contact with (and come under the influence \nof) those external changes? He is sure, however,\nto keep his points of contact with them from being many. The park of Shih-wei, the \ngarden of Hwang-Tî, the palace of the Lord of Yü, and the houses of Thang and Wû;—(these \nall were places in which this was done). But the superior men (so called, of later days), \nsuch as the masters of the Literati and of Mohism, were bold to attack each other with \ntheir controversies; and how much more so are the men of the present day! Sages in dealing \nwith others do not wound them; and they who do not wound others cannot be wounded by them. \nOnly he whom others do not injure is able to welcome and meet men.'Forests and marshes make me joyful and glad; but before the joy is ended, sadness comes \nand succeeds to it. When sadness and joy come, I cannot prevent their approach; when they \ngo, I cannot retain them. How sad it is that men should only be as lodging-houses for \nthings, (and the emotions which they excite)! They know what they meet, but they do not \nknow what they do not meet; they use what power they have, but they cannot be strong where \nthey are powerless. Such ignorance and powerlessness is what men cannot avoid. That they \nshould try to avoid what they cannot avoid, is not this also sad? Perfect speech is to \nput speech away; perfect action is to put action away; to digest all knowledge that is \nknown is a thing to be despised.'"

    "BOOK XXIII. KÄNG-SANG KHÛ.": "\nI. Among the disciples \nof Lâo Tan there was a Käng-sang Khû, who had got a greater \nknowledge than the others of his doctrines, and took up his residence with it in the north \nat the hill of Wei-lêi. \nHis servants who were pretentious and knowing he sent away, \nand his concubines who were officious and kindly he kept at a distance; living (only) \nwith those who were boorish and rude, and employing (only) the bustling and ill-mannered. \nAfter three years there was great prosperity in Wei-lêi, and the people said to one \nanother, 'When Mr. Käng-sang first came here, he alarmed us, and we thought him strange; \nour estimate of him after a short acquaintance was that he could not do us much good; \nbut now that we have known him for years, we find him a more than ordinary benefit. Must \nhe not be near being a sage? Why should you not\n\nunite in blessing him as the representative of our departed (whom we worship), and raise \nan altar to him as we do to the spirit of the grain?' Käng-sang heard of it, kept his \nface indeed to the south but was dissatisfied.\n\nHis disciples thought it strange in him, but he said to them, 'Why, my disciples, should \nyou think this strange in me? When the airs of spring come forth, all vegetation grows; \nand, when the autumn arrives, all the previous fruits of the earth are matured. Do spring \nand autumn have these effects without any adequate cause? The processes of the Great Tâo \nhave been in operation. I have heard that the Perfect man dwells idly in his apartment \nwithin its surrounding walls, \nand the people get wild and crazy, not knowing how they \nshould repair to him. Now these small people of Wei-lêi in their opinionative way want \nto present their offerings to me, and place me among such men of ability and virtue. But \nam I a man to be set up as such a model? It is on this account that I am dissatisfied \nwhen I think of the words of Lâo Tan.'\n\n2. His disciples said, 'Not so. In ditches eight cubits wide, or even twice as much, big \nfishes cannot turn their bodies about, but minnows and eels find them sufficient for them; \non hillocks six or\n\nseven cubits high, large beasts cannot conceal themselves, but foxes of evil omen find \nit a good place for them. And moreover, honour should be paid to the wise, offices given \nto the able, and preference shown to the good and the beneficial. From of old Yâo and \nShun acted thus;—how much more may the people of Wei-lêi do so! O Master, let them \nhave their way!'\n\nKäng-sang replied, 'Come nearer, my little children. If a beast that could hold a carriage \nin its mouth leave its hill by itself, it will not escape the danger that awaits it from \nthe net; or if a fish that could swallow a boat be left dry by the flowing away of the \nwater, then (even) the ants are able to trouble it. Thus it is that birds and beasts seek \nto be as high as possible, and fishes and turtles seek to lie as deep as possible. In \nthe same way men who wish to preserve their bodies and lives keep their persons concealed, \nand they do so in the deepest retirement possible. And moreover, what was there in those \nsovereigns to entitle them to your laudatory mention? Their sophistical reasonings (resembled) \nthe reckless breaking down of walls and enclosures and planting the wild rub us and wormwood \nin their place; or making the hair thin before they combed it; or counting the grains \nof rice before they cooked them. They would do such things with careful discrimination; \nbut what was there in them to benefit the world? If you raise the men of talent to office, \nyou will create disorder; making the people strive with one\n\nanother for promotion; if you employ men for their wisdom, the people will rob one another \n(of their reputation). \nThese various things are insufficient to make the people good \nand honest. They are very eager for gain;—a son will kill his father, and a minister \nhis ruler (for it). In broad daylight men will rob, and at midday break through walls. \nI tell you that the root of the greatest disorder was planted in the times of Yâo and \nShun. The branches of it will remain for a thousand ages; and after a thousand ages men \nwill be found eating one another.)\n\n3. (On this) Nan-yung Khû \nabruptly sat right up and said, 'What method can an old man \nlike me adopt to become (the Perfect man) that you have described?' Käng-sang Dze said, \n'Maintain your body complete; hold your life in close embrace; and do not let your thoughts \nkeep working anxiously:—do this for three years, and you may become the man of whom \nI have spoken.' The other rejoined, 'Eyes are all of the same form, I do not know any \ndifference between them:—yet the blind have no power of vision. Ears are all of the \nsame form; I do not know any difference between them:—yet the deaf have no power \nof hearing. Minds are all of the same nature, I do not know any difference between them;—yet \nthe mad cannot make the minds of other men their own. (My) personality is indeed like \n(yours), but things seem to separate\n\nbetween us. \nI wish to find in myself what there is in you, but I am not able to do \nso'. You have now said to me, \"Maintain your body complete; hold your life in close embrace; \nand do not let your thoughts keep working anxiously.\" With all my efforts to learn your \nWay, (your words) reach only my ears.' Käng-sang replied, 'I can say nothing more to you,' \nand then he added, 'Small flies cannot transform the bean caterpillar; Yüeh fowls cannot hatch the eggs of geese, but Lû fowls can. It is not that the nature of these \nfowls is different; the ability in the one case and inability in the other arise from \ntheir different capacities as large and small. My ability is small and not sufficient \nto transform you. Why should you not go south and see Lâo-dze?'\n\n4. Nan-yung Khû hereupon took with him some rations, and after seven days and seven nights \narrived at the abode of Lâo-dze, who said to him, 'Are you come from Khû's?' 'I am,' was \nthe reply. 'And why, Sir, have you come with such a multitude of attendants?' Nan-yung \nwas frightened, and turned his head round to look behind him. Lâo-dze said, 'Do you not \nunderstand my meaning?' The other held his head down and was ashamed, and then he lifted \nit up, and sighed, saying, 'I forgot at the moment what I should reply to your\n\nquestion, and in consequence I have lost what I wished to ask you.' 'What do you mean?' \nIf I have not wisdom, men say that I am stupid, while if I have it, it occasions distress \nto myself. If I have not benevolence, then (I am charged) with doing hurt to others, while \nif I have it, I distress myself. If I have not righteousness, I (am charged with) injuring \nothers, while if I have it, I distress myself. How can I escape from these dilemmas? These \nare the three perplexities that trouble me; and I wish at the suggestion of Khû to ask \nyou about them.' Lao-dze replied, 'A little time ago, when I saw you and looked right \ninto your eyes, \nI understood you, and now your words confirm the judgment which I formed. \nYou look frightened and amazed. You have lost your parents, and are trying with a pole \nto find them at the (bottom of) the sea. You have gone astray; you are at your wit's end. \nYou wish to recover your proper nature, and you know not what step to take first to find \nit. You are to be pitied!'\n\n5. Nan-yung Khû asked to be allowed to enter (the establishment), and have an apartment \nassigned to him. \n(There) he sought to realise the qualities which he loved, and put \naway those which he hated. For ten days he afflicted himself, and then waited again on \nLâo-dze, who said to him, 'You must purify yourself thoroughly! But from your symptoms \nof\n\ndistress, and signs of impurity about you, I see there still seem to cling to you things \nthat you dislike. When the fettering influences from without become numerous, and you \ntry to seize them (you will find it a difficult task); the better plan is to bar your \ninner man against their entrance. And when the similar influences within get intertwined, \nit is a difficult task to grasp (and hold them in check); the better plan is to bar the \nouter door against their exit. Even a master of the Tâo and its characteristics will not \nbe able to control these two influences together, and how much less can one who is only \na student of the Tâo do so!' Nan-yung Khû said, 'A certain villager got an illness, and \nwhen his neighbours asked about it, he was able to describe the malady, though it was \none from which he had not suffered before. When I ask you about the Grand Tâo, it seems \nto me like drinking medicine which (only serves to) increase my illness. I should like \nto hear from you about the regular method of guarding the life;—that will be sufficient \nfor me.' Lao-dze replied, '(You ask me about) the regular method of guarding the life;—can \nyou hold the One thing fast in your embrace? Can you keep from losing it? Can you know \nthe lucky and the unlucky without having recourse to the tortoise-shell or the divining \nstalks? Can you rest (where you ought to rest)? Can you stop (when you have got enough)? \nCan you give over thinking of other men, and seek what you want in yourself (alone)? Can \nyou flee (from the allurements of desire)? Can you maintain an entire simplicity? Can \nyou become a little child? The child will cry all the day, without its throat becoming \nhoarse;—so perfect is the harmony (of\n\nits physical constitution). It will keep its fingers closed all the day without relaxing \ntheir grasp;—such is the concentration of its powers. It will keep its eyes fixed \nall day, without their moving;—so is it unaffected by what is external to it. It \nwalks it knows not whither; it rests where it is placed, it knows not why; it is calmly \nindifferent to things, and follows their current. This is the regular method of guarding \nthe life.'\n\n6. Nan-yung Khû said, 'And are these all the characteristics of the Perfect man?' Lao-dze \nreplied, 'No. These are what we call the breaking up of the ice, and the dissolving of \nthe cold. The Perfect man, along with other men, gets his food from the earth, and derives \nhis joy from his Heaven (-conferred nature). But he does not like them allow himself to \nbe troubled by the consideration of advantage or injury coming from men and things; he \ndoes not like them do strange things, or form plans, or enter on undertakings; he flees \nfrom the allurements of desire, and pursues his way with an entire simplicity. Such is \nthe way by which he guards his life.' 'And is this what constitutes his perfection?' 'Not \nquite. I asked you whether you could become a little child. The little child moves unconscious \nof what it is doing, and walks unconscious of whither it is going. Its body is like the \nbranch of a rotten tree, and its mind is like slaked lime. Being such, misery does \nnot come to it, nor happiness. It has\n\nneither misery nor happiness;—how can it suffer from the calamities incident to men?'\n\n7.  He whose mind is thus grandly fixed \nemits a Heavenly light. In him who emits \nthis heavenly light men see the (True) man. When a man has cultivated himself (up to this \npoint), thenceforth he remains constant in himself. When he is thus constant in himself, \n(what is merely) the human element will leave him', but Heaven will help him. Those whom \ntheir human element has left we call the people of Heaven. Those whom Heaven helps \nwe call the Sons of Heaven. Those who would by learning attain to this seek for what they cannot\n\nlearn. Those who would by effort attain to this, attempt what effort can never effect. \nThose who aim by reasoning to reach it reason where reasoning has no place. To know to \nstop where they cannot arrive by means of knowledge is the highest attainment. Those who \ncannot do this will be destroyed on the lathe of Heaven.\n\n8. Where things are all adjusted to maintain the body; where a provision against unforeseen \ndangers is kept up to maintain the life of the mind; where an inward reverence is cherished \nto be exhibited (in all intercourse) with others;—where this is done, and yet all \nevils arrive, they are from Heaven, and not from the men themselves. They will not be \nsufficient to confound the established (virtue of the character), or be admitted into \nthe Tower of Intelligence. That Tower has its Guardian, who acts unconsciously, and whose \ncare will not be effective, if there be any conscious purpose in it. If one who has \nnot this entire sincerity in himself make any outward demonstration, every such demonstration \nwill be incorrect. The thing will enter into him, and not let go its hold. Then with every \nfresh demonstration there will be still greater failure. If he do what is not good in \nthe light of open day, men will have the opportunity of punishing him; if he do it in \ndarkness and secrecy, spirits \nWill inflict the punishment. Let a man understand this—his \nrelation both to men and spirits, and then he will do what is good in the solitude of \nhimself.\n\nHe whose rule of life is in himself does not act for the sake of a name. He whose rule \nis outside himself has his will set on extensive acquisition. He who does not act for \nthe sake of a name emits a light even in his ordinary conduct; he whose will is set on \nextensive acquisition is but a trafficker. Men see how he stands on tiptoe, while he thinks \nthat he is overtopping others. Things enter (and take possession of) him who (tries to) \nmake himself exhaustively (acquainted with them), while when one is indifferent to them, \nthey do not find any lodgment in his person. And how can other men find such lodgment? \nBut when one denies lodgment to men, there are none who feel attachment to him. In this \ncondition he is cut off from other men. There is no weapon more deadly than the will;—even \nMû-yê was inferior to \nit. There is no robber greater than the Yin and Yang, from whom \nnothing can escape of all between heaven and earth. But it is not the Yin and Yang that \nplay the robber;—it is the mind that causes them to do so.\n\n9. The Tâo is to be found in the subdivisions (of its subject); (it is to be found) in \nthat when complete, and when broken up. What I dislike in considering it as subdivided, \nis that the division leads to the multiplication of it;—and what I dislike in that \nmultiplication is that it leads to the (thought of) effort to secure it. Therefore when \n(a man)\n\ncomes forth (and is born), if he did not return (to his previous non-existence), we should \nhave (only) seen his ghost; when he comes forth and gets this (return), he dies (as we \nsay). He is extinguished, and yet has a real existence:—this is another way of saying \nthat in life we have) only man's ghost. By taking the material as an emblem of the immaterial \ndo we arrive at a settlement of the case of man. He comes forth, but from no root; he \nreenters, but by no aperture. He has a real existence. but it has nothing to do with place; \nhe has continuance, but it has nothing to do with beginning or end. He has a real existence, \nbut it has nothing to do with place, such is his relation to space; he has continuance, \nbut it has nothing to do with beginning or end, such is his relation to time; he has life; \nhe has death; he comes forth; he enters; but we do not see his form;—all this is \nwhat is called the door of Heaven. The door of Heaven is Non-Existence. All things come \nfrom non-existence. The (first) existences could not bring themselves into existence; \nthey must have come from non-existence. And non-existence is just the same as non-existing. \nHerein is the secret of the sages.\n\n10. Among the ancients there were those whose knowledge reached the extreme point. And \nwhat was that point? There were some who thought that in the beginning there was nothing. \nThis was the extreme point, the completest reach of their knowledge, to which nothing \ncould be added. Again, there were those who supposed that (in the beginning) there were \nexistences, proceeding to consider life to be a (gradual) perishing, and death a returning \n(to the original state). And there they stopped,\n\nmaking, (however), a distinction between life and death. Once again there were those who \nsaid, 'In the beginning there was nothing; by and by there was life; and then in a little \ntime life was succeeded by death. We hold that non-existence was the head, life the body, \nand death the os coccygis. But of those who acknowledge that existence and nonexistence, \ndeath and life, are all under the One Keeper, we are the friends.' Though those who maintained \nthese three views were different, they were so as the different branches of the same ruling \nFamily (of Khû),—the \nKâos and the Kings, bearing the surname of the lord whom they honoured as the \nauthor of their branch, and the Kiâs named from their appanage;—(all \none, yet seeming) not to be one.\n\nThe possession of life is like the soot that collects under a boiler. When that is differently \ndistributed, the life is spoken of as different. But to say that life is different in \ndifferent lives, and better in one than in another, is an improper mode of speech. And \nyet there may be something here which we do not know. (As for instance), at the lâ sacrifice \nthe paunch and the divided hoofs may be set forth on separate dishes, but they should \nnot be considered as parts of different victims; (and again), when one is inspecting a \nhouse, he goes over it all, even the adytum for the shrines of the temple, and visits \nalso the most private apartments; doing this, and setting a different estimate on the \ndifferent parts.\n\nLet me try and speak of this method of apportioning\n\none's approval:—life is the fundamental consideration in it; knowledge is the instructor. \nFrom this they multiply their approvals and disapprovals, determining what is merely nominal \nand what is real. They go on to conclude that to themselves must the appeal be made in \neverything, and to try to make others adopt them as their model; prepared even to die \nto make good their views on every point. In this way they consider being employed in office \nas a mark of wisdom, and not being so employed as a mark of stupidity, success as entitling \nto fame, and the want of it as disgraceful. The men of the present day who follow this \ndifferentiating method are like the cicada and the little dove;—there is no difference between them.\n\n11. When one treads on the foot of another in the market-place, he apologises on the ground \nof the bustle. If an elder tread on his younger brother, he proceeds to comfort him; if \na parent tread on a child, he says and does nothing. Hence it is said, 'The greatest politeness \nis to show no special respect to others; the greatest righteousness is to take no account \nof things; the greatest wisdom is to lay no plans; the greatest benevolence is to make \nno demonstration of affection; the greatest good faith is to give no pledge of sincerity.'\n\nRepress the impulses of the will; unravel the errors of the mind; put away the entanglements \nto virtue; and clear away all that obstructs the free course of the Tâo. Honours and riches, \ndistinctions and austerity, fame and profit; these six things produce the impulses of \nthe will. Personal appearance\n\nand deportment, the desire of beauty and subtle reasonings, excitement of the breath and \ncherished thoughts; these six things produce errors of the mind. Hatred and longings, \njoy and anger, grief and delight; these six things are the entanglements to virtue. Refusals \nand approachments, receiving and giving, knowledge and ability; these six things obstruct \nthe course of the Tâo. When these four conditions, with the six causes of each, do not \nagitate the breast, the mind is correct. Being correct, it is still; being still, it is \npellucid; being pellucid, it is free from pre-occupation; being free from pre-occupation, \nit is in the state of inaction, in which it accomplishes everything.\n\nThe Tâo is the object of reverence to all the virtues. Life is what gives opportunity \nfor the display of the virtues. The nature is the substantive character of the life. The \nmovement of the nature is called action. When action becomes hypocritical, we say that \nit has lost (its proper attribute).\n\nThe wise communicate with what is external to them and are always laying plans. This is \nwhat with all their wisdom they are not aware of;—they look at things askance. When \nthe action (of the nature) is from external constraint, we have what is called virtue; \nwhen it is all one's own, we have what is called government. These two names seem to be \nopposite to each other, but in reality they are in mutual accord.\n\n12. Î was skilful in \nhitting the minutest mark, but stupid in wishing men to go on \npraising him without end. The sage is skilful Heavenwards, but stupid\n\nmanwards. It is only the complete man who can be both skilful Heavenwards and good manwards.\n\nOnly an insect can play the insect, only an insect show the insect nature. Even the complete \nman hates the attempt to exemplify the nature of Heaven. He hates the manner in which \nmen do so, and how much more would he hate the doing so by himself before men!\n\nWhen a bird came in the way of Î, he was sure to obtain it;—such was his mastery \nwith his bow. If all the world were to be made a cage, birds would have nowhere to escape \nto. Thus it was that Thang caged Î Yin by making him his cook, and that duke Mû of \nKhin caged Pâi-lî Hsî by giving the skins of five rams for him. But if you try to cage \nmen by anything but what they like, you will never succeed.\n\nA man, one of whose feet has been cut off, discards ornamental (clothes);—his outward \nappearance will not admit of admiration. A criminal under sentence of death will ascend \nto any height without fear;—he has ceased to think of life or death.\n\nWhen one persists in not reciprocating the gifts (of friendship), he forgets all others. \nHaving forgotten all others, he may be considered as a Heaven-like man. Therefore when \nrespect is shown to a man, and it awakens in him no joy, and when contempt awakens no \nanger, it is only one who shares in the Heaven-like harmony that can be thus. When he \nwould display anger and yet is not angry, the anger comes out in that repression of it. \nWhen he would put forth action, and yet does not do so,\n\nthe action is in that not-acting. Desiring to be quiescent, he must pacify all his emotions; \ndesiring to be spirit-like, he must act in conformity with his mind. When action is required \nof him, he wishes that it may be right; and it then is under an inevitable constraint. \nThose who act according to that inevitable constraint pursue the way of the sage.\n"

    "BOOK XXIV. HSÜ WÛ-KWEI.": "\n1. Hsü Wû-kwei having obtained through Nü Shang an introduction to the marquis Wû of \nWei, the marquis, \nspeaking to him with kindly sympathy, said, 'You are ill, Sir; \nyou have suffered from your hard and laborious toils \nin the forests, and still you have been willing to come and see poor me.' Hsü Wû-kwei replied, \n'It is I who have to comfort your lordship; what occasion have you to comfort me? If your lordship go on \nto fill up the measure of your sensual desires, and to prolong your likes and dislikes, \nthen the condition of your mental nature will be diseased, and if you discourage and repress \nthose desires, and deny your likings and dislikings, that will be an affliction to your \nears and eyes\n\n(deprived of their accustomed pleasures);—it is for me to comfort your lordship, \nwhat occasion have you to comfort me?' The marquis looked contemptuous, and made no reply.\n\nAfter a little time, Hsü Wû-kwei said, 'Let me tell your lordship something:—I look \nat dogs and judge of them by their appearance. One of the lowest quality seizes his \nfood, satiates himself, and stops;—he has the attributes of a fox. One of a medium \nquality seems to be looking at the sun. One of the highest quality seems to have forgotten \nthe one thing,—himself. But I judge still better of horses than I do of dogs. When \nI do so, I find that one goes straightforward, as if following a line; that another turns \noff, so as to describe a hook; that a third describes a square as if following the measure \nso called; and that a fourth describes a circle as exactly as a compass would make it. \nThese are all horses of a state; but they are not equal to a horse of the kingdom. His \nqualities are complete. Now he looks anxious; now to be losing the way; now to be forgetting \nhimself. Such a horse prances along, or rushes on, spurning the dust and not knowing where \nhe is.' The marquis was greatly pleased and laughed.\n\nWhen Hsü Wû-kwei came out, Nü Shang said to him, 'How was it, Sir, that you by your counsels \nproduced such an effect on our ruler? In my counsellings of him, now indirectly, taking \nmy subjects from the Books of Poetry, History, Rites, and Music; now directly, from the \nMetal Tablets, and the \nsix Bow-cases, all calculated for the service (of the\n\nstate), and to be of great benefit;—in these counsellings, repeated times without \nnumber, I have never seen the ruler show his teeth in a smile:—by what counsels have \nyou made him so pleased to-day?' Hsü Wû-kwei replied, 'I only told him how I judged of \ndogs and horses by looking at their appearance.' 'So?' said Nü Shang, and the other rejoined, \n'Have you not heard of the wanderer from Yüeh? when he had been gone from the state \nseveral days, he was glad when he saw any one whom he had seen in it; when he had been \ngone a month, he was glad when he saw any one whom he had known in it; and when he had \nbeen gone a round year, he was glad when he saw any one who looked like a native of it. \nThe longer he was gone, the more longingly did he think of the people;—was it not \nso? The men who withdraw to empty valleys, where the hellebore bushes stop up the little \npaths made by the weasels, as they push their way or stand amid the waste, are glad when \nthey seem to hear the sounds of human footsteps; and how much more would they be so, if \nit were their brothers and relatives talking and laughing by their side! How long it is \nsince the words of a True \nman were heard as he talked and laughed by our ruler's side!'\n\n2. At (another) interview of Hsü Wû-kwei with the marquis Wû, the latter said, 'You, Sir, \nhave been dwelling in the forests for a long time, living\n\non acorns and chestnuts, and satiating yourself with onions and chives, without thinking \nof poor me. Now (that you are here), is it because you are old? or because you wish to \ntry again the taste of wine and meat? or because (you wish that) I may enjoy the happiness \nderived from the spirits of the altars of the Land and Grain?' Hsü Wû-kwei replied, 'I \nwas born in a poor and mean condition, and have never presumed to drink of your lordship's \nwine, or eat of your meat. My object in coming was to comfort your lordship under your \ntroubles.' 'What? comfort me under my troubles?' 'Yes, to comfort both your lordship's \nspirit and body.' The marquis said, 'What do you mean?' His visitor replied, 'Heaven and \nEarth have one and the same purpose in the production (of all men). However high one man \nbe exalted, he should not think that he is favourably dealt with; and however low may \nbe the position of another, he should not think that he is unfavourably dealt with. You \nare indeed the one and only lord of the 10,000 chariots (of your state), but you use your \ndignity to embitter (the lives of) all the people, and to pamper your cars, eyes, nose, \nand mouth. But your spirit does not acquiesce in this. The spirit (of man) loves to be \nin harmony with others and hates selfish indulgence. This selfish indulgence is a disease, \nand therefore I would comfort you under it. How is it that your lordship more than others \nbrings this disease on yourself?' The marquis said, 'I have wished to see you, Sir, for \na long time. I want to love my people, and by the exercise of righteousness to make an end of war;—will that be sufficient?' Hsü Wû-kwei replied, 'By no \nmeans. To love the people is the first step to injure them'. By the exercise of righteousness \nto make an end of war is the root from which war is produced. If your lordship try to \naccomplish your object in this way, you are not likely to succeed. All attempts to accomplish \nwhat we think good (with an ulterior end) is a bad contrivance. Although your lordship \npractise benevolence and righteousness (as you propose), it will be no better than hypocrisy. \nYou may indeed assume the (outward) form, but successful accomplishment will lead to (inward) \ncontention, and the change thence arising will produce outward fighting. Your lordship \nalso must not mass files of soldiers in the passages of your galleries and towers, nor \nhave footmen and horsemen in the apartments about your altars. Do not let thoughts \ncontrary to your success lie hidden in your mind; do not think of conquering men by artifice, \nor by (skilful) plans, or by fighting. If I kill the officers and people of another state, \nand annex its territory, to satisfy my selfish desires, while in my spirit I do not know \nwhether the fighting be good, where is the victory that I gain? Your lordship's best plan \nis to abandon (your purpose). If you will cultivate in your breast the sincere purpose \n(to love the people), and so respond to the feeling of Heaven and Earth, and not (further) \nvex yourself, then your people will already have- escaped death;—what\n\noccasion will your lordship have to make an end of war?'\n\n3. Hwang-Tî was going to see Tâ-kwei at the hill of Kü-zhze. Fang Ming was acting as \ncharioteer, and Khang Yü was occupying the third place in the carriage. Kang Zo and Hsî \nPhäng went before the horses; and Khwän Hwun and Kû Khî followed the carriage. When they \narrived at the wild of Hsiang-khäng, the seven sages were all perplexed, and could find \nno place at which to ask the way. just then they met with a boy tending some horses, and \nasked the way of him. 'Do you know,' they said, 'the hill of Kü-zhze?' and he replied \nthat he did. He also said that he knew where Tâ-kwei was living. 'A strange boy is this!' \nsaid Hwang-Tî. 'He not only knows the hill of Kü-zhze, but he also knows where Tâ-kwei \nis living. Let me ask him about the government of mankind.' The boy said, 'The administration \nof the kingdom is like this (which I am doing);—what difficulty should there be in \nit? When I was young, I enjoyed myself roaming over all within the six confines of the \nworld of space, and then I began to suffer from indistinct sight. A wise elder taught \nme, saying, \"Ride in the chariot of the\n\nsun, and roam in the wild of Hsiang-Khäng.\" Now the trouble in my eyes is a little better, \nand I am again enjoying myself roaming outside the six confines of the world of space. \nAs to the government of the kingdom, it is like this (which I am doing);what difficulty \nshould there be in it?' Hwang-Tî said, 'The administration of the world is indeed not \nyour business, my son; nevertheless, I beg to ask you about it.' The little lad declined \nto answer, but on Hwang-Tî putting the question again, he said, 'In what does the governor \nof the kingdom differ from him who has the tending of horses, and who has only to put \naway whatever in him would injure the horses?'\n\nHwang-Tî bowed to him twice with his head to the ground, called him his 'Heavenly Master,' \nand withdrew.\n\n4. If officers of wisdom do not see the changes which their anxious thinking has suggested, \nthey have no joy; if debaters are not able to set forth their views in orderly style, \nthey have no joy; if critical examiners find no subjects on which to exercise their powers \nof vituperation, they have no joy:—they are all hampered by external restrictions.\n\nThose who try to attract the attention of their age (wish to) rise at court; those who \ntry to win the regard of the people count holding office a glory; those who possess \nmuscular strength boast of doing what is difficult; those who are bold and daring exert \nthemselves in times of calamity; those who are able\n\nswordmen and spearmen delight in fighting; those whose powers are decayed seek to rest \nin the name (they have gained); those who are skilled in the laws seek to enlarge the \nscope of government; those who are proficient in ceremonies and music pay careful attention \nto their deportment; and those who profess benevolence and righteousness value opportunities \n(for displaying them).\n\nThe husbandmen who do not keep their fields well weeded are not equal to their business, \nnor are traders who do not thrive in the markets. When the common people have their appropriate \nemployment morning and evening, they stimulate one another to diligence; the mechanics \nwho are masters of their implements feel strong for their work. If their wealth does not \nincrease, the greedy are distressed; if their power and influence is not growing, the \nambitious are sad.\n\nSuch creatures of circumstance and things delight in changes, and if they meet with a \ntime when they can show what they can do, they cannot keep themselves from taking advantage \nof it. They all pursue their own way like (the seasons of) the year, and do not change \nas things do. They give the reins to their bodies and natures, and allow themselves to \nsink beneath (the pressure of) things, and all their lifetime do not come back (to their \nproper selves):—is it not sad?\n\n5. Kwang-dze said, 'An archer, without taking aim beforehand, yet may hit the mark. If \nwe say that he is a good archer, and that all the world may\n\nbe is Îs, is this \nallowable?' Hui-dze replied, 'It is.' Kwang-dze continued, 'All men \ndo not agree in counting the same thing to be right, but every one maintains his own view \nto be right; (if we say) that all men may be Yâos, is this allowable?' Hui-dze (again) \nreplied, 'It is;' and Kwang-dze went on, 'Very well; there are the literati, the followers \nof Mo (Tî), of Yang (Kû), and of Ping;—making four (different schools). Including \nyourself, Master, there are five. Which of your views is really right? Or will you take \nthe position of La Kü? \nOne of his disciples said to him, \"Master, I have got hold of \nyour method. I can in winter heat the furnace under my tripod, and in summer can produce \nice.\" Lû Kü said, \"That is only with the Yang element to call out the same, and with the \nYin to call out the yin;—that is not my method. I will show you what my method is.\" \nOn this he tuned two citherns, placing one of them in the hall, and the other in one of \nthe inner apartments. Striking the note Kung in the one, the same note vibrated in \nthe other, and so it was with the note Kio; the two instruments being tuned in the \nsame way. But if he had differently tuned them on other strings different\n\nfrom the normal arrangement of the five notes, the five-and-twenty strings would all have \nvibrated, without any difference of their notes, the note to which he had tuned them ruling \nand guiding all the others. Is your maintaining your view to be right just like this?'\n\nHui-dze replied, 'Here now are the literati, and the followers of Mo, Yang, and Ping. \nSuppose that they have come to dispute with me. They put forth their conflicting statements; \nthey try vociferously to put me down; but none of them have ever proved me wrong —what \ndo you say to this?' Kwang-dze said, 'There was a man of Khî who cast away his son in \nSung to be a gatekeeper there, and thinking nothing of the mutilation lie would incur; \nthe same man, to secure one of his sacrificial vessels or bells, would have it strapped \nand secured, while to find his son who was lost, he would not go out of the territory \nof his own state:—so forgetful was he of the relative importance of things. If a \nman of Khû, going to another state as a lame gate-keeper, at midnight, at a time when \nno one was nigh, were to fight with his boatman, he would not be able to reach the shore, \nand he would have done what he could to provoke the boatman's animosity.'\n\n6. As Kwang-dze was accompanying a funeral, when passing by the grave of Hui-dze, he looked\n\nround, and said to his attendants, 'On the top of the nose of that man of Ying there \nis a (little) bit of mud like a fly's wing,' He sent for the artisan Shih to cut it away. \nShih whirled his axe so as to produce a wind, which immediately carried off the mud entirely, \nleaving the nose uninjured, and the (statue of) the man of Ying' standing undisturbed. \nThe ruler Yüan of Sung \nheard of the feat, called the artisan Shih, and said to him, \n'Try and do the same thing on me.' The artisan said, 'Your servant has been able to trim \nthings in that way, but the material on which I have worked has been dead for a long time.' \nKwang-dze said, 'Since the death of the Master, I have had no material to work upon. I \nhave had no one with whom to talk.'\n\n7. Kwan Kung being ill, duke Hwan went to ask for him, and said, 'Your illness, father \nKung, is very severe; should you not speak out your mind to me? Should this prove the \ngreat illness, to whom will it be best for me to entrust my State?' Kwan Kung said, 'To \nwhom does your grace wish to entrust it?' 'To Pâo Shû-yâ,' was the reply. 'He will \nnot do. He is an admirable officer, pure and incorruptible, but with others who are not \nlike himself he will not associate. And when he once hears\n\nof another man's faults, he never forgets them. If you employ him to administer the state, \nabove, he will take the leading of your Grace, and, below, he will come into collision \nwith the people;—in no long time you will be holding him as an offender.' The duke \nsaid, 'Who, then, is the man?' The reply was, 'If I must speak, there is Hsî Phäng;— he \nwill do. He is a man who forgets his own high position, and against whom those below him \nwill not revolt. He is ashamed that he is not equal to Hwang-Tî, and pities those who \nare not equal to himself. Him who imparts of his virtue to others we call a sage; him \nwho imparts of his wealth to others we call a man of worth. He who by his worth would \npreside over others, never succeeds in winning them; he who with his worth condescends \nto others, never but succeeds in winning them. Hsî Phäng has not been (much) heard of \nin the state; he has not been (much) distinguished in his own clan. But as I must speak, \nhe is the man for you.'\n\n8. The king of Wû, floating about on the Kiang, (landed and) ascended the Hill of monkeys, \nwhich all, when they saw him, scampered off in terror, and hid themselves among the thick \nhazels. There was one, however, which, in an unconcerned way, swung about on the branches, \ndisplaying its cleverness to the king, who thereon discharged an arrow at it. With a nimble \nmotion it caught the swift arrow, and the king ordered his attendants to hurry forward \nand shoot it; and thus the monkey was seized and killed. The king then, looking round, \nsaid to his friend Yen\n\nPû-î, 'This monkey \nmade a display of its artfulness, and trusted in its agility, to \nshow me its arrogance;—this it was which brought it to this fate. Take warning from \nit. Ah! do not by your looks give yourself haughty airs!' Yen Pû-î, when he returned \nhome, put himself under the teaching of Tung Wû, \nto root up his pride. He put away \nwhat he delighted in and abjured distinction. In three years the people of the kingdom \nspoke of him with admiration.\n\n9. Nan-po Dze-khî was \nseated, leaning forward on his stool, and sighing gently as he \nlooked up to heaven. (just then) Yen Khäng-dze \ncame in, and said, when he saw him, \n'Master, you surpass all others. Is it right to make your body thus like a mass of withered \nbones, and your mind like so much slaked lime?' The other said, 'I formerly lived in a \ngrotto on a hill. At that time Thien Ho once came to see me, and all the multitudes \nof Khî congratulated him thrice (on his having found the proper man). I must first have \nshown myself, and so it was that he knew me; I must first have been selling (what I had), \nand so it was that he came to buy. If I had not shown what I possessed, how should he \nhave known it; if I had not been selling (myself), how should he have come to buy me? \nI pity\n\nthe men who lose themselves; \nI also pity the men who pity others (for not being known); \nand I also pity the men who pity the men who pity those that pity others. But since then \nthe time is long cone by; (and so I am in the state in which you have found me).\n\n10. Kung-nî, having gone to Khû, the king ordered wine to be presented to him. Sun Shû-âo \nstood, holding the goblet in his hand. Î-liâo of Shih-nan, having received (a cup), \npoured its contents out as a sacrificial libation, and said, 'The men of old, on such \nan occasion as this, made some speech.' Kung-nî said, 'I have heard of speech without \nwords; but I have never spoken it; I will do so now. Î-liâo of Shih-nan kept (quietly) \nhandling his little spheres,\n\nand the difficulties between the two Houses were resolved; Sun Shû-âo slept undisturbed \non his couch, with his (dancer's) feather in his hand, and the men of Ying enrolled themselves \nfor the war. I wish I had a beak three cubits long.'\n\nIn the case of those two (ministers) we have what is called 'The Way that cannot be trodden;' \nin (the case of Kung-nî) we have what is called 'the Argument without words.' Therefore \nwhen all attributes are comprehended in the unity of the Tâo, and speech stops at the \npoint to which knowledge does not reach, the conduct is complete. But where there is (not) \nthe unity of the Tâo, the attributes cannot (always) be the same, and that which is beyond \nthe reach of knowledge cannot be exhibited by any reasoning. There may be as many names \nas those employed by the Literati and the Mohists, but (the result is) evil. Thus when \nthe sea does not reject the streams that flow into it in their eastward course, we have \nthe perfection of greatness. The sage embraces in his regard both Heaven and Earth; his \nbeneficent influence extends to all under the sky; and we do not know from whom it comes. \nTherefore though when living one may have no rank, and when dead no honorary epithet; \nthough the reality (of what he is) may not be acknowledged and his name not established; \nwe have in him what is called 'The Great Man.'\n\nA dog is not reckoned good because it barks well; and a man is not reckoned wise because \nhe speaks\n\nskilfully;—how much less can he be deemed Great! If one thinks he is Great, he is \nnot fit to be accounted Great;—how much less is he so from the practice of the attributes \n(of the Tâo)! \nNow none are so grandly complete as Heaven and Earth; but do they seek \nfor anything to make them so grandly complete? He who knows this grand completion does \nnot seek for it; he loses nothing and abandons nothing; he does not change himself from \nregard to (external) things; he turns in on himself, and finds there an inexhaustible \nstore; he follows antiquity and does not feel about (for its lessons);—such is the \nperfect sincerity of the Great Man.\n\n11. Dze-khî had eight sons. \nHaving arranged them before him, he called Kiû-fang Yän, and said to him, 'Look at the physiognomy of my \nsons for me;—which will be the fortunate \none?' Yän said, 'Khwän is the fortunate one.' .Dze-khî looked startled, and joyfully said, \n'In what way?' Yän replied, 'Khwän will share the meals of the ruler of a state to the \nend of his life.' The father looked uneasy, burst into tears, and said, 'What has my son \ndone that he should come to such a fate?' Yin replied, 'When one shares the meals of the \nruler of a state, blessings reach to all within the three branches of his kindred, \nand how much more to his father and mother! But you, Master, weep when you hear this;—you \noppose (the idea of) such happiness. It is the good fortune of your son, and\n\nyou count it his misfortune.' Dze-khî said, 'O Yän, what sufficient ground have you for \nknowing that this will be Khwän's good fortune? (The fortune) that is summed up in wine \nand flesh affects only the nose and the mouth, but you are not able to know how it will \ncome about. I have never been a shepherd, and yet a ewe lambed in the south-west corner \nof my house. I have never been fond of hunting, and yet a quail hatched her young in the \nsouth-east corner. If these were not prodigies, what can be accounted such? Where I wish \nto occupy my mind with my son is in (the wide sphere of) heaven and earth; I wish to seek \nhis enjoyment and mine in (the idea of) Heaven, and our support from the Earth. I do not \nmix myself up with him in the affairs (of the world); nor in forming plans (for his advantage); \nnor in the practice of what is strange. I pursue with him the perfect virtue of Heaven \nand Earth, and do not allow ourselves to be troubled by outward things. I seek to be with \nhim in a state of undisturbed indifference, and not to practise what affairs might indicate \nas likely to be advantageous. And now there is to come to us this vulgar recompense. Whenever \nthere is a strange realisation, there must have been strange conduct. Danger threatens;—not \nthrough any sin of me or of my son, but as brought about, I apprehend, by Heaven. It is \nthis which makes me weep!'\n\nNot long after this, .Dze-khî sent off Khwän to go to Yen, when he was made prisoner \nby some robbers on the way. It would have been difficult to sell him if he were whole \nand entire, and they thought\n\ntheir easiest plan was to cut off (one of his) feet first. They did so, and sold him in \nKhî, where he became Inspector of roads for a Mr. Khü. Nevertheless he had flesh to eat till he died.\n\n12. Nieh Khüeh met Hsü Yû (on the way), and said to him, 'Where, Sir, are you going to?' \n'I am fleeing from Yâo,' was the reply. 'What do you mean?' 'Yâo has become so bent on \nhis benevolence that I am afraid the world will laugh at him, and that in future ages \nmen will be found eating one another. Now the people are collected together without \ndifficulty. Love them, and they respond with affection; benefit them, and they come to \nyou; praise them, and they are stimulated (to please you); make them to experience what \nthey dislike, and they disperse. When the loving and benefiting proceed from benevolence \nand righteousness, those who forget the benevolence and righteousness, and those who make \na profit of them, are the many. In this way the practice of benevolence and righteousness \ncomes to be without sincerity and is like a borrowing of the instruments with which men \ncatch birds. \nIn all this the one man's seeking to benefit the world by his decisions \nand enactments (of such a nature) is as if he were to cut through (the nature of all) \nby one operation;—Yâo knows how wise and superior men can benefit the world, but \nhe does not\n\nalso know how they injure it. It is only those who stand outside such men that know this.'\n\nThere are the pliable and weak; the easy and hasty; the grasping and crooked. Those who \nare called the pliable and weak learn the words of some one master, to which they freely \nyield their assent, being secretly pleased with themselves, and thinking that their knowledge \nis sufficient, while they do not know that they have not yet begun (to understand) a single \nthing. It is this which makes them so pliable and weak. The easy and hasty are like lice \non a pig. The lice select a place where the bristles are more wide apart, and look on \nit as a great palace or a large park. The slits between the toes, the overlappings of \nits skin, about its nipples and its thighs,—all these seem to them safe apartments \nand advantageous places;—they do not know that the butcher one morning, swinging \nabout his arms, will spread the grass, and kindle the fire, so that they and the pig will \nbe roasted together. So do they appear and disappear with the place where they harboured:—this \nis why they are called the easy and hasty.\n\nOf the grasping and crooked we have an example in Shun. Mutton has no craving for ants, \nbut ants have a craving for mutton, for it is rank. There was a rankness about the conduct \nof Shun, and the people were pleased with him. Hence when he thrice changed his residence, \nevery one of them became a capital city. When he came to the wild\n\nof Täng, he \nhad 100,000 families about him. Yâo having heard of the virtue and ability \nof Shun, appointed him to a new and uncultivated territory, saying, 'I look forward to \nthe benefit of his coming here.' When Shun was appointed to this new territory, his years \nwere advanced, and his intelligence was decayed;—and yet he could not find a place \nof rest or a home. This is an example of being grasping and wayward.\n\nTherefore (in opposition to such) the spirit-like man dislikes the flocking of the multitudes \nto him. When the multitudes come, they do not agree; and when they do not agree, no benefit \nresults from their coming. Hence there are none whom he brings very near to himself, and \nnone whom he keeps at a great distance. He keeps his virtue in close embrace, and warmly \nnourishes (the spirit of) harmony, so as to be in accordance with all men. This is called \nthe True man. \nEven the knowledge of the ant he puts away; his plans are simply those \nof the fishes; \neven the notions of the sheep he discards. His seeing is simply that \nof the eye; his hearing that of the ear; his mind is governed by its general exercises. \nBeing such, his course is straight and level as if marked out by a line, and its every \nchange is in accordance (with the circumstances of the case).\n\n13. The True men of old waited for the issues of events as the arrangements of Heaven, \nand did not by their human efforts try to take the place of Heaven. The True men of old \n(now) looked on\n\nsuccess as life and on failure as death; and (now) on success as death and on failure \nas life. The operation of medicines will illustrate this:—there are monk's-bane, \nthe kieh-käng, the tribulus fruit, and china-root; each of these has the time and case \nfor which it is supremely suitable; and all such plants and their suitabilities cannot \nbe mentioned particularly. Kâu-kien took his station on (the hill of) Kwâi-khî with \n3,000 men with their buff-coats and shields:—(his minister) Kung knew how the ruined \n(Yüeh) might still be preserved, but the same man did not know the sad fate in store for \nhimself. Hence it is said, \n'The eye of the owl has its proper fitness; the leg of the \ncrane has its proper limit, and to cut off any of it would distress (the bird).' Hence \n(also) it is (further) said, 'When the wind passes over it, the volume of the river is \ndiminished, and so it is when the sun passes over it. But let the wind and sun keep a \nwatch together on the river, and it will not begin to feel that they are doing it any \ninjury:—it relies on its springs and flows on.' Thus, water does its part to the \nground with undeviating exactness; and so does the shadow to the substance; and one thing \nto another. Therefore there is danger from the power of vision in the eyes, of hearing \nin the ears, and of the inordinate thinking of the mind; yea, there is danger from the \nexercise of every power of which man's constitution is the depository.\n\nWhen the danger has come to a head, it cannot be averted, and the calamity is perpetuated, \nand goes on increasing. The return from this (to a state of security) is the result of \n(great) effort, and success can be attained only after a long time; and yet men consider \n(their power of self-determination) as their precious possession:—is it not sad? \nIt is in this way that we have the ruin of states and the slaughtering of the people without \nend; while no one knows how to ask how it comes about.\n\n14. Therefore, the feet of man on the earth tread but on a small space, but going on to \nwhere he has not trod before, he traverses a great distance easily; so his knowledge is \nbut small, but going on to what he does not already know, he comes to know what is meant \nby Heaven. \nHe knows it as The Great Unity; The Great Mystery; The Great Illuminator; \nThe Great Framer; The Great Boundlessness; The Great Truth; The Great Determiner. This \nmakes his knowledge complete. As The Great Unity, he comprehends it; as The Great Mystery, \nhe unfolds it; as the Great Illuminator, he contemplates it; as the Great Framer, it is \nto him the Cause of all; as the Great Boundlessness, all is to him its embodiment; as \nThe Great Truth, he examines it; as The Great Determiner, he holds it fast.\n\nThus Heaven is to him all; accordance with it is the brightest intelligence. Obscurity \nhas in this its pivot; in this is the beginning. Such being the\n\ncase, the explanation of it is as if it were no explanation; the knowledge of it is as \nif it were no knowledge. (At first) he does not know it, but afterwards he comes to know \nit. In his inquiries, he must not set to himself any limits, and yet he cannot be without \na limit. Now ascending, now descending, then slipping from the grasp, (the Tâo) is yet \na reality, unchanged now as in antiquity, and always without defect:—may it not be \ncalled what is capable of the greatest display and expansion? Why should we not inquire \ninto it? Why should we be perplexed about it? With what does not perplex let us explain \nwhat perplexes, till we cease to be perplexed. So may we arrive at a great freedom from \nall perplexity!\n"

    "BOOK XXV. ZEH-YANG.": "\n1. Zeh-yang having travelled to Khû, Î Kieh spoke of him to the king, and then, before \nthe king had granted him an interview, (left him, and) returned home. Zeh-yang went to \nsee Wang Kwo, \nand said to him, 'Master, why do you not mention me to the king?' Wang \nKwo replied, 'I am not so good a person to do that as Kung-yüeh Hsiû.' 'What sort of \nman is he?' asked the other, and the reply was, 'In winter he spears turtles in the Kiang, \nand in summer he rests in shady places on the mountain. When passers-by ask him (what \nhe is doing there), he says, \"This is my abode.\" Since Î Kieh was not able to induce the \nking to see you, how much less should I, who am not equal to him, be able to do so! Î \nKieh's character is this:—he has no (real) virtue, but he has knowledge. If you do \nnot freely yield yourself to him, but employ him to carry on his spirit-like influence \n(with you), you will certainly get upset and benighted in the region of riches and honours. \nHis help will not be of a virtuous character, but will go to make your virtue\n\nless;—it will be like heaping on clothes in spring as a protection against cold, \nor bringing back the cold winds of winter as a protection against heat (in summer). Now \nthe king of Khû is of a domineering presence and stern. He has no forgiveness for offenders, \nbut is merciless as a tiger. It is only a man of subtle speech, or one of correct virtue, \nwho can bend him from his purpose.\n\n'But the sagely man, \nwhen he is left in obscurity, causes the members of his family \nto forget their poverty; and, when he gets forward to a position of influence, causes \nkings and dukes to forget their rank and emoluments, and transforms them to be humble. \nWith the inferior creatures, he shares their pleasures, and they enjoy themselves the \nmore; with other men, he rejoices in the fellowship of the Tâo, and preserves it in himself. \nTherefore though he may not speak, he gives them to drink of the harmony (of his spirit). \nStanding in association with them, he transforms them till they become in their feeling \ntowards him as sons with a father. His wish is to return to the solitude of his own mind, \nand this is the effect of his occasional intercourse with them. So far-reaching is his \ninfluence on the minds of men; and therefore I said to you. \"Wait for Kung-yüeh Hsiû.\"'\n\n2. The sage comprehends the connexions between himself and others, and how they all go \nto constitute him of one body with them, and he does not know how it is so;—he naturally \ndoes so. In fulfilling his constitution, as acted on and acting, he\n\n(Simply) follows the direction of Heaven; and it is in consequence of this that men style \nhim (a sage). If he were troubled about (the insufficiency of) his knowledge, what he \ndid would always be but small, and sometimes would be arrested altogether;—how would \nhe in this case be (the sage)? When (the sage) is born with all his excellence, it is \nother men who see it for him. If they did not tell him, he would not know that he was \nmore excellent than others. And when he knows it, he is as if he did not know it; when \nhe hears it, he is as if he did not hear it. His source of joy in it has no end, and men's \nadmiration of him has no end;—all this takes place naturally. The love of the \nsage for others receives its name from them. If they did not tell him of it, he would \nnot know that he loved them; and when he knows it, he is as if he knew it not; when he \nhears it, he is as if he heard it not. His love of others never has an end, and their \nrest in him has also no end:—all this takes place naturally.\n\n3. When one sees at a distance his old country and old city, he feels a joyous satisfaction. \nThough it be full of mounds and an overgrowth of trees and grass, and when he enters it \nhe finds but a tenth part remaining, still he feels that satisfaction. How much more when \nhe sees what he saw, and hears what he heard before! All this is to him like a tower eighty \ncubits high exhibited in the sight of all men.\n\n(The sovereign) Zän-hsiang \nwas possessed of that central principle round which all \nthings revolve, \nand by it he could follow them to their completion. His accompanying \nthem had neither ending nor beginning, and was independent of impulse or time. Daily he \nwitnessed their changes, and himself underwent no change; and why should he not have rested \nin this? If we (try to) adopt Heaven as our Master, we incapacitate ourselves from doing \nso. Such endeavour brings us under the power of things. If one acts in this way, what \nis to be said of him? The sage never thinks of Heaven nor of men. He does not think of \ntaking the initiative, nor of anything external to himself. He moves along with his age, \nand does not vary or fail. Amid all the completeness of his doings, he is never exhausted. \nFor those who wish to be in accord with him, what other course is there to pursue?\n\nWhen Thang got one to hold for him the reins of government, namely, Män-yin Täng-häng, \nhe employed him as his teacher. He followed his master, but did not allow himself to be \nhampered by him, and so he succeeded in following things to their completion. The master \nhad the name; but that name was a superfluous addition to his laws, and the twofold character \nof his government was made apparent. Kung-nî's 'Task your thoughts to the utmost' was \nhis expression of the duties of a\n\nmaster. Yung-khäng said, 'Take the days away and there will be no year; without what is \ninternal there will be nothing external.'\n\n4. (King) Yung \nof Wei made a treaty with the marquis Thien Mâu (of Khî), which the \nlatter violated. The king was enraged, and intended to send a man to assassinate him. \nWhen the Minister of War \nheard of it, he was ashamed, and said (to the king), 'You \nare a ruler of 10,000 chariots, and by means of a common man would avenge yourself on \nyour enemy. I beg you to give me, Yen, the command of 200,000 soldiers to attack him for \nyou. I will take captive his people and officers, halter (and lead off) his oxen and horses, \nkindling a fire within him that shall burn to his backbone. I will then storm his capital; \nand when he shall run away in terror, I will flog his back and break his spine.' Kî-dze \nheard of this advice, and was ashamed of it, and said (to the king), 'We have been raising \nthe wall (of our capital) to a height of eighty cubits, and the work has been completed. \nIf we now get it thrown down, it will be a painful toil to the convict builders. It is \nnow seven years\n\nsince our troops were called out, and this is the foundation of the royal sway. Yen would \nintroduce disorder;—he should not be listened to.' Hwâ-dze heard of this advice, \nand, greatly disapproving of it, said (to the king), 'He who shows his skill in saying \n\"Attack Khî\" would produce disorder; and he who shows his skill in saying \"Do not attack \nit\" would also produce disorder. And one who should (merely) say, \"The counsellors to \nattack Khî and not to attack it would both produce disorder,\" would himself also lead \nto the same result.' The king said, 'Yes, but what am I to do?' The reply was, 'You have \nonly to seek for (the rule of) the Tâo (on the subject).'\n\nHui-dze, having heard of this counsel, introduced to the king Tâi Zin-zän, who said, \n'There is the creature called a snail; does your majesty know it?' 'I do.' 'On the left \nhorn of the snail there is a kingdom which is called Provocation, and on the right horn \nanother which is called Stupidity. These two kingdoms are continually striving about their \nterritories and fighting. The corpses that lie on the ground amount to several myriads. \nThe army of one may be defeated and put to flight, but in fifteen days it will return.' \nThe king said, 'Pooh! that is empty talk!' The other rejoined, 'Your servant begs to show \nyour majesty its real significance. When your majesty thinks of space—east, west, \nnorth, and south, above and beneath—can you set any limit to it?' 'It is illimitable,' \nsaid the king; and his visitor went on, 'Your majesty knows\n\nhow to let your mind thus travel through the illimitable, and yet (as compared with this) \ndoes it not seem insignificant whether the kingdoms that communicate one with another \nexist or not?' The king replies, 'It does so;' and Tâi Zin-zän said, finally, 'Among those \nkingdoms, stretching one after another, there is this Wei; in Wei there is this (city \nof) Liang; \nand in Liang there is your majesty. Can you make any distinction between \nyourself, and (the king of that kingdom of) Stupidity?' To this the king answered, 'There \nis no distinction,' and his visitor went out, while the king remained disconcerted and \nseemed to have lost himself.\n\nWhen the visitor was gone, Hui-dze came in and saw the king, who said, 'That stranger \nis a Great man. An (ordinary) sage is not equal to him.' Hui-dze replied, 'If you blow \ninto a flute, there come out its pleasant notes; if you blow into a sword-hilt, there \nis nothing but a wheezing sound. Yâo and Shun are the subjects of men's praises, but if \nyou speak of them before Tai Zin-zän, there will be but the wheezing sound.'\n\n5. Confucius, having gone to Khû, was lodging in the house of a seller of Congee at Ant-hill. \nOn the roof of a neighbouring house there appeared the husband and his wife, with their \nservants, male and female. \nDze-lû said, 'What are those people doing,\n\ncollected there as we see them?' Kung-nî replied, 'The man is a disciple of the sages. \nHe is burying himself among the people, and hiding among the fields. Reputation has become \nlittle in his eyes, but there is no bound to his cherished aims. Though he may speak with \nhis mouth, he never tells what is in his mind. Moreover, he is at variance with the age, \nand his mind disdains to associate with it;—he is one who may be said to lie hid \nat the bottom of the water on the dry land. Is he not a sort of Î Liâo of Shih-nan?' Dze-lû \nasked leave to go and call him, but Confucius said, 'Stop. He knows that I understand \nhim well. He knows that I am come to Khû, and thinks that I am sure to try and get the \nking to invite him (to court). He also thinks that I am a man swift to speak. Being such \na man, he would feel ashamed to listen to the words of one of voluble and flattering tongue, \nand how much more to come himself and see his person! And why should we think that he \nwill remain here?' Dze-lû, however, went to see how it was, but found the house empty.\n\n6. The Border-warden of Khang-wû, in questioning Dze-lâo, said, 'Let not a ruler \nin the exercise of his government be (like the farmer) who leaves the clods unbroken, \nnor, in regulating his people, (like one) who recklessly plucks up the shoots. Formerly, \nin ploughing my corn-fields, I left the clods unbroken, and my recompense was in the rough \nunsatisfactory crops; and in weeding, I destroyed and tore up (many good plants), and \nmy recompense was in the scantiness of my harvests. In subsequent\n\nyears I changed my methods, ploughing deeply and carefully covering up the seed; and my \nharvests were rich and abundant, so that all the year I had more than I could eat.' When \nKwang-dze heard of his remarks, he said, 'Now-a-days, most men, in attending to their \nbodies and regulating their minds, correspond to the description of the Border-warden. \nThey hide from themselves their Heaven(-given being); they leave (all care of) their (proper) \nnature; they extinguish their (proper) feelings; and they leave their spirit to die:—abandoning \nthemselves to what is the general practice. Thus dealing with their nature like the farmer \nwho is negligent of the clods in his soil, the illegitimate results of their likings and \ndislikings become their nature. The bushy sedges, reeds, and rushes, which seem at first \nto spring up to support our bodies, gradually eradicate our nature, and it becomes like \na mass of running sores, ever liable to flow out, with scabs and ulcers, discharging in \nflowing matter from the internal heat. So indeed it is!'\n\n7. Po Kü \nwas studying with Lâo Tan, and asked his leave to go and travel everywhere. \nLao Tan said, 'Nay;—elsewhere it is just as here.' He repeated his request, and then \nLâo Tan said, 'Where would you go first?' 'I would begin with Khî,' replied the disciple. \nHaving got there, I would go to look at the criminals (who had been executed). With my \narms I would raise (one of) them up and set him on his feet, and, taking off my court \nrobes, I would cover him with them, appealing at\n\nthe same time to Heaven and bewailing his lot, while I said, \"My son, my son, you have \nbeen one of the first to suffer from the great calamities that afflict the world.\"' \n(Lâo Tan) said25, '(It is said), \"Do \nnot rob. Do not kill.\" (But) in the setting \nup of (the ideas of) glory and disgrace, we see the cause of those evils; in the accumulation \nof property and wealth, we see the causes of strife and contention. If now you set up \nthe things against which men fret; if you accumulate what produces strife and contention \namong them; if you put their persons in such a state of distress, that they have no rest \nor ease, although you may wish that they should not come to the end of those (criminals), \ncan your wish be realised?\n\n'The superior men (and rulers) of old considered that the success (of their government) \nwas to be found in (the state of) the people, and its failure to be sought in themselves; \nthat the right might be with the people, and the wrong in themselves. Thus it was that \nif but a single person lost his life, they retired and blamed themselves. Now, however, \nit is not so. (Rulers) conceal what they want done, and hold those who do not know it \nto be stupid; they require what is very difficult, and condemn those who do not dare to \nundertake it; they impose heavy burdens, and punish those who are unequal to them; they \nrequire men to go far, and put them to death when they cannot accomplish the distance. \nWhen the people know that the utmost of their\n\nstrength will be insufficient, they follow it up with deceit. When (the rulers) daily \nexhibit much hypocrisy, how can the officers and people not be hypocritical? Insufficiency \nof strength produces hypocrisy; insufficiency of knowledge produces deception; insufficiency \nof means produces robbery. But in this case against whom ought the robbery and theft to \nbe charged?'\n\n8. When Kü Po-yü was in his sixtieth year, his views became changed in the course of it. \nHe had never before done anything but consider the views which he held to be right, but \nnow he came to condemn them as wrong; he did not know that what he now called right was \nnot what for fifty-nine years he had been calling wrong. All things have the life (which \nwe know), but we do not see its root; they have their goings forth, but we do not know \nthe door by which they depart. Men all honour that which lies within the sphere of their \nknowledge, but they do not know their dependence on what lies without that sphere which \nwould be their (true) knowledge:—may we not call their case one of great perplexity? \nAh! Ah! there is no escaping from this dilemma. So it is! So it is!\n\n9. Kung-nî asked the Grand Historiographer Tâ Thâo, (along with) Po Khang-khien and \nKhih-wei, saying, 'Duke Ling of Wei was so addicted to\n\ndrink, and abandoned to sensuality, that he did not attend to the government of his state. \nOccupied in his pursuit of hunting with his nets and bows, he kept aloof from the meetings \nof the princes. In what was it that he showed his title to the epithet of Ling?' Tâ \nThâo said, 'It was on account of those very things.' Po Khang-khien said, 'Duke Ling had \nthree mistresses with whom he used to bathe in the same tub. (Once, however), when Shih-zhiû \ncame to him with presents from the imperial court, he made his servants support the messenger \nin bearing the gifts. \nSo dissolute was he in the former case, and when he saw a man \nof worth, thus reverent was he to him. It was on this account that he was styled \"Duke \nLing.\" Khih-wei said, 'When duke Ling died, and they divined about burying him in the \nold tomb of his House, the answer was unfavourable; when they divined about burying him \non Shâ-khiû, the answer was favourable. Accordingly they dug there to the depth of several \nfathoms, and found a stone coffin. Having washed and inspected it, they discovered an \ninscription, which said,\n\n\"This grave will not be available for your posterity;\nDuke Ling will appropriate it for himself.\"\n\nThus that epithet of Ling had long been settled for the duke. But how should those \ntwo be able to know this?'\n\n10. Shâo Kih asked Thâi-kung Thiâo, saying, 'What do we mean by \"The Talk of the \nHamlets and Villages?\" The reply was, 'Hamlets and Villages are formed by the union—say \nof ten surnames and a hundred names, and are considered to be (the source of) manners \nand customs. The differences between them are united to form their common character, and \nwhat is common to them is separately apportioned to form the differences. If you point \nto the various parts which make up the body of a horse, you do not have the horse; but \nwhen the horse is before you, and all its various parts stand forth (as forming the animal), \nyou speak of \"the horse.\" So it is that the mounds and hills are made to be the elevations \nthat they are by accumulations of earth which individually are but low. (So also rivers \nlike) the Kiang and the Ho obtain their greatness by the union of (other smaller) waters \nwith them. And (in the same way) the Great man exhibits the common sentiment of humanity \nby the union in himself of all its individualities. Hence when ideas come to him from \nwithout, though he\n\nhas his own decided view, he does not hold it with bigotry; and when he gives out his \nown decisions, which are correct, the views of others do not oppose them. The four seasons \nhave their different elemental characters, but they are not the partial gifts of Heaven, \nand so the year completes its course. The five official departments have their different \nduties, but the ruler does not partially employ any one of them, and so the kingdom is \ngoverned. (The gifts of) peace and war(are different), but the Great man does not employ \nthe one to the prejudice of the other, and so the character (of his administration) is \nperfect. All things have their different constitutions and modes of actions, but the Tâo \n(which directs them) is free from all partiality, and therefore it has no name. Having \nno name, it therefore does nothing. Doing nothing, there is nothing which it does not \ndo.\n\n'Each season has its ending and beginning; each age has its changes and transformations; \nmisery and happiness regularly alternate. Here our views are thwarted, and yet the result \nmay afterwards have our approval; there we insist on our own views, and looking at things \ndifferently from others, try to correct them, while we are in error ourselves. The case \nmay be compared to that of a great marsh, in which all its various vegetation finds a \nplace, or we may look at it as a great hill, where trees and rocks are found on the same \nterrace. Such may be a description of what is intended by \"The Talk of the Hamlets and \nVillages.\"'\n\nShâo Kih said, 'Well, is it sufficient to call it (an expression of) the Tâo?' Thâi-kung \nThiâo said, 'It is not so. If we reckon up the number of things,\n\nthey are not 10,000 merely. When we speak of them as \"the Myriad Things,\" we simply use \nthat large number by way of accommodation to denominate them. In this way Heaven and Earth \nare the greatest of all things that have form; the Yin and Yang are the greatest of all \nelemental forces. But the Tâo is common to them. Because of their greatness to use the \nTâo or (Course) as a title and call it \"the Great Tâo\" is allowable. But what comparison \ncan be drawn between it and \"the Talk of the Hamlets and Villages?\" To argue from this \nthat it is a sufficient expression of the Tâo, is like calling a dog and a horse by the \nsame name, while the difference between them is so great.'\n\n11. Shâo Kih said, 'Within the limits of the four cardinal points, and the six boundaries \nof space, how was it that there commenced the production of all things?' Thâi-kung Thiâo \nreplied, 'The Yin and Yang reflected light on each other, covered each other, and regulated \neach the other; the four seasons gave place to one another, produced one another, and \nbrought one another to an end. Likings and dislikings, the avoidings of this and movements \ntowards that, then arose (in the things thus produced), in their definite distinctness; \nand from this came the separation and union of the male and female. Then were seen now \nsecurity and now insecurity, in mutual change; misery and happiness produced each other; \ngentleness and urgency pressed on each other; the movements of collection and dispersion \nwere established:—these names and processes can be examined, and, however minute, \ncan be recorded. The rules determining the order in which they follow one another, their \nmutual influence\n\nnow acting directly and now revolving, how, when they are exhausted, they revive, and \nhow they end and begin again; these are the properties belonging to things. Words can \ndescribe them and knowledge can reach to them; but with this ends all that can be said \nof things. Men who study the Tâo do not follow on when these operations end, nor try to \nsearch out how they began:—with this all discussion of them stops.'\n\nShâo Kih said, 'Kî Kän \nholds that (the Tâo) forbids all action, and Kieh-dze \nholds that it may perhaps allow of influence. Which of the two is correct in his statements, \nand which is one-sided in his ruling?' Thâi-kung Thiâo replied, 'Cocks crow and dogs bark;—this \nis what all men know. But men with the greatest wisdom cannot describe in words whence \nit is that they are formed (with such different voices), nor can they find out by thinking \nwhat they wish to do. We may refine on this small point; till it is so minute that there \nis no point to operate on, or it may become so great that there is no embracing it. \"Some \none caused it;\" \"No one did it;\" but we are thus debating about things; and the end is \nthat we shall find we are in error. \"Some one caused it;\"—then there was a real Being. \n\"No one did it;\"—then there was mere vacancy. To have a name and a real existence,-that \nis the condition of a thing. Not to have a name, and not\n\nto have real being;—that is vacancy and no thing. We may speak and we may think about \nit, but the more we speak, the wider shall we be of the mark. Birth, before it comes, \ncannot be prevented; death, when it has happened, cannot be traced farther. Death and \nlife are not far apart; but why they have taken place cannot be seen. That some one has \ncaused them, or that there has been no action in the case are but speculations of doubt. \nWhen I look for their origin, it goes back into infinity; when I look for their end, it \nproceeds without termination. Infinite, unceasing, there is no room for words about (the \nTâo). To regard it as in the category of things is the origin of the language that it \nis caused or that it is the result of doing nothing; but it would end as it began with \nthings. The Tâo cannot have a (real) existence; if it has, it cannot be made to appear \nas if it had not. The name Tâo is a metaphor, used for the purpose of description. \nTo say that it causes or does nothing is but to speak of one phase of things, and has \nnothing to do with the Great Subject. If words were sufficient for the purpose, in a day's \ntime we might exhaust it; since they are not sufficient, we may speak all day, and only \nexhaust (the subject of) things. The Tâo is the extreme to which things conduct us. Neither \nspeech nor silence is sufficient to convey the notion of it. Neither by speech nor by \nsilence can our thoughts about it have their highest expression.\n"

    "BOOK XXVI. WÂI WÛ.": "\n1. What comes from without cannot be determined beforehand. So it was that Lung-fäng \nwas killed; Pî-kan immolated; and the count of Kî (made to feign himself) mad, (while) \nO-lâi died, \nand Kieh and Kâu both perished. Rulers all wish their ministers to be faithful, \nbut that faithfulness may not secure their confidence; hence Wû Yün became a wanderer \nalong the Kiang, \nand Khang Hung died in Shû, where (the people) preserved his blood \nfor three years, when it became changed into green jade. Parents all wish their sons \nto be filial, but that filial duty may not secure their love; hence\n\nHsiâo-kî \nhad to endure his sorrow, and Zäng Shän his grief.\n\nWhen wood is rubbed against wood, it begins to burn; when metal is subjected to fire, \nit (melts and) flows. When the Yin and Yang act awry, heaven and earth are greatly perturbed; \nand on this comes the crash of thunder, and from the rain comes fire, which consumes great \nlocust trees. \n(The case of men) is still worse. They are troubled between two pitfalls, \nfrom which they cannot escape. Chrysalis-like, they can accomplish nothing. Their minds \nare as if hung up between heaven and earth. Now comforted, now pitied, they are plunged \nin difficulties. The ideas of profit and of injury rub against each other, and produce \nin them a very great fire. The harmony (of the mind) is consumed in the mass of men. Their \nmoonlike intelligence cannot overcome the (inward) fire. They thereupon fall away more \nand more, and the Course (which they should pursue) is altogether lost.\n\n2. The family of Kwang Kâu being poor, he went to ask the loan of some rice from the Marquis \nSuperintendent of the Ho, \nwho said, 'Yes, I shall be\n\ngetting the (tax-) money from the people (soon), and I will then lend you three hundred \nounces of silver;—will that do?' Kwang Kâu flushed with anger, and said, 'On the \nroad yesterday, as I was coming here, I heard some one calling out. On looking round, \nI saw a goby in the carriage rut, and said to it, \"Goby fish, what has brought you here?\" \nThe goby said, \"I am Minister of Waves in the Eastern Sea. Have you, Sir, a gallon or \na pint of water to keep me alive?\" I replied, \"Yes, I am going south to see the kings \nof Wû and Yüeh, and I will then lead a stream from the Western Kiang to meet you;—will \nthat do?\" The goby flushed with anger, and said, \"I have lost my proper element, and I \ncan here do nothing for myself; but if I could get a gallon or a pint of water, I should \nkeep alive. Than do what you propose, you had better soon look for me in a stall of dry \nfish.\"'\n\n3. A son of the duke of Zän, \nhaving provided himself with a great hook, a powerful \nblack line, and fifty steers to be used as bait, squatted down on (mount) Kwâi Khî, and \nthrew the line into the Eastern Sea. Morning after morning he angled thus, and for a whole \nyear caught nothing. At the end of that time, a great fish swallowed the bait, and dived \ndown, dragging the great hook with him.\n\nThen it rose to the surface in a flurry, and flapped with its fins, till the white waves \nrose like hills, and the waters were lashed into fury. The noise was like that of imps \nand spirits, and spread terror\n\nfor a thousand lî. The prince having got such a fish, cut it in slices and dried them. \nFrom the Keh river \nto the cast, and from Zhang-Wû \nto the north, there was not one \nwho did not eat his full from that fish; and in subsequent generations, story-tellers \nof small abilities have all repeated the story to one another with astonishment. (But) \nif the prince had taken his rod, with a fine line, and gone to pools and ditches, and \nwatched for minnows and gobies, it would have been difficult for him to get a large fish. \nThose who dress up their small tales to obtain favour with the magistrates are far from \nbeing men of great understanding; and therefore one who has not heard the story of this \nscion of Zän is not fit to take any part in the government of the world;—far is he \nfrom being so.\n\n4. Some literati, students of the Odes and Ceremonies, were breaking open a mound over \na grave. \nThe superior among them spoke down to the others, 'Day is breaking in the \neast; how is the thing going on?' The younger men replied, 'We have not yet opened his \njacket and skirt, but there is a pearl in the mouth. As it is said in the Ode,\n\n\"The bright, green grain\nIs growing on the sides of the mound.\nWhile living, he gave nothing away;\nWhy, when dead, should he hold a pearl in his mouth?\"'\n\nThereupon they took hold of the whiskers and pulled at the beard, while the superior introduced \na piece of fine steel into the chin, and gradually separated the jaws, so as not to injure \nthe pearl in the mouth.\n\n5. A disciple of Lâo Lâi-dze, while he was out gathering firewood, met with Kung-nî. \nOn his return, he told (his master), saying, 'There is a man there, the upper part of \nwhose body is long and the lower part short. He is slightly hump-backed, and his ears \nare far back. When you look at him, he seems occupied with the cares of all within the \nfour seas I do not know whose son he is.' Lâo Lâi-dze said, It is Khiû; call him here;' \nand when Kung-nî came, he said to him, 'Khiû, put away your personal conceit, and airs \nof wisdom, and show yourself to be indeed a superior man.' Kung-nî bowed and was retiring, \nwhen he abruptly changed his manner, and asked, 'Will the object I am pursuing be thereby \nadvanced?' Lao Lâi-dze replied, 'You cannot bear the sufferings of this one age, and are \nstubbornly regardless of the\n\nevils of a myriad ages:—is it that you purposely make yourself thus unhappy? or is \nit that you have not the ability to comprehend the case? Your obstinate purpose to make \nmen rejoice in a participation of your joy is your life-long shame, the procedure of a \nmediocre man. You would lead men by your fame; you would bind them to you by your secret \nart. Than be praising Yâo and condemning Kieh, you had better forget them both, and shut \nup your tendency to praise. If you reflect on it, it does nothing but injury; your action \nin it is entirely wrong. The sage is full of anxiety and indecision in undertaking anything, \nand so he is always successful. But what shall I say of your conduct? To the end it is \nall affectation.'\n\n6. The ruler Yüan of Sung \n(once) dreamt at midnight that a man with dishevelled hair \npeeped in on him at a side door and said, 'I was coming from the abyss of commissioned \nby the Clear Kiang to go to the place of the Earl of the Ho; but the fisherman Yü Zü has \ncaught me.' When the ruler Yüan awoke, he caused a diviner to divine the meaning (of the \ndream), and was told, 'This is a marvellous tortoise.' The ruler asked if among the fishermen \nthere was one called Yü Zü, and being told by his attendants that there was, he gave orders \nthat he should be summoned to court. Accordingly the man next day appeared at court, and \nthe ruler said, 'What have you caught (lately) in fishing?' The reply was, 'I have caught \nin my net a white tortoise, sieve-like, and five cubits round.' 'Present the prodigy here,' \nsaid the ruler; and, when it came, once and\n\nagain he wished to kill it, once and again he wished to keep it alive. Doubting in his \nmind (what to do), he had recourse to divination, and obtained the answer, 'To kill the \ntortoise for use in divining will be fortunate.' Accordingly they cut the creature open, \nand perforated its shell in seventy-two places, and there was not a single divining slip \nwhich failed.\n\nKung-nî said, 'The spirit-like tortoise could show itself in a dream to the ruler Yüan, \nand yet it could not avoid the net of Yü Zü. Its wisdom could respond on seventy-two perforations \nwithout failing in a single divination, and yet it could not avoid the agony of having \nits bowels all scooped out. We see from this that wisdom is not without its perils, and \nspirit-like intelligence does not reach to everything. A man may have the greatest wisdom, \nbut there are a myriad men scheming against him. Fishes do not fear the net, though they \nfear the pelican. Put away your small wisdom, and your great wisdom will be bright; discard \nyour skilfulness, and you will become naturally skilful. A child when it is born needs \nno great master, and yet it becomes able to speak, living (as it does) among those who \nare able to speak.'\n\n7. Hui-dze said to Kwang-dze, 'You speak, Sir, of what is of no use.' The reply was, 'When \na man knows what is not useful, you can then begin to speak to him of what is useful. \nThe earth for instance is certainly spacious and great; but what a\n\nman uses of it is only sufficient ground for his feet. If, however, a rent were made by \nthe side of his feet, down to the yellow springs, could the man still make use of it?' \nHui-dze said, 'He could not use it,' and Kwang-dze rejoined, 'Then the usefulness of what \nis of no use is clear.'\n\n8. Kwang-dze said, 'If a man have the power to enjoy himself (in any pursuit), can he \nbe kept from doing so? If he have not the power, can he so enjoy himself? There are those \nwhose aim is bent on concealing themselves, and those who are determined that their doings \nshall leave no trace. Alas! they both shirk the obligations of perfect knowledge and great \nvirtue. The (latter) fall, and cannot recover themselves; the (former) rush on like fire, \nand do not consider (what they are doing). Though men may stand to each other in the relation \nof ruler and minister, that is but for a time. In a changed age, the one of them would \nnot be able to look down on the other. Hence it is said, \"The Perfect man leaves no traces \nof his conduct.\"\n\n'To honour antiquity and despise the present time is the characteristic of learners; \nbut even the disciples of Khih-wei \nhave to look at the present age; and who can avoid \nbeing carried along by its course? It is only the Perfect man who is able to enjoy himself \nin the world, and not be deflected from the right,\n\nto accommodate himself to others and not lose himself. He does not learn their lessons; \nhe only takes their ideas into consideration, and does not discard them as different from \nhis own.\n\n9. 'It is the penetrating eye that gives clear vision, the acute car that gives quick \nhearing, the discriminating nose that gives discernment of odours, the practised mouth \nthat gives the enjoyment of flavours, the active mind that acquires knowledge, and the \nfar-reaching knowledge that constitutes virtue. In no case does the connexion with what \nis without like to be obstructed; obstruction produces stoppage; stoppage, continuing \nwithout intermission, arrests all progress; and with this all injurious effects spring \nup.\n\n'The knowledge of all creatures depends on their breathing. But if their breath be \nnot abundant, it is not the fault of Heaven, which tries to penetrate them with it, day \nand night without ceasing; but men notwithstanding shut their pores against it. The womb \nencloses a large and empty space; the heart has its spontaneous and enjoyable movements. \nIf their apartment be not roomy, wife and mother-in-law will be bickering; if the heart \nhave not its spontaneous and enjoyable movements, the six faculties of perception will \nbe in mutual collision. That\n\nthe great forests, the heights and hills, are pleasant to men, is because their spirits \ncannot overcome (those distracting influences). Virtue overflows into (the love of) fame; \n(the love of) fame overflows into violence; schemes originate in the urgency (of circumstances); \n(the show of) wisdom comes from rivalry; the fuel (of strife) is produced from the obstinate \nmaintenance (of one's own views); the business of offices should be apportioned in accordance \nwith the approval of all. In spring, when the rain and the sunshine come seasonably, vegetation \ngrows luxuriantly, and sickles and hoes begin to be prepared. More than half of what had \nfallen down becomes straight, and we do not know how.\n\n10. 'Stillness and silence are helpful to those who are ill; rubbing the corners of the \neyes is helpful to the aged; rest serves to calm agitation; but they are the toiled and \ntroubled who have recourse to these things. Those who are at ease, and have not had such \nexperiences, do not care to ask about them. The spirit-like man has had no experience \nof how it is that the sagely man keeps the world in awe, and so he does not inquire about \nit; the sagely man has had no experience of how it is that the man of ability and virtue \nkeeps his age in awe, and so he does not inquire about it; the man of ability and virtue \nhas had no experience of how it is that the superior man keeps his state in awe, and so \nhe does not inquire about it. The superior man has had no experience of how it is that \nthe small man keeps himself in agreement with his times that he should inquire about it.'\n\n11. The keeper of the Yen Gate, \non the death of\n\nhis father, showed so much skill in emaciating his person that he received the rank \nof 'Pattern for Officers.' Half the people of his neighbourhood (in consequence) carried \ntheir emaciation to such a point that they died. When Yâo wished to resign the throne \nto Hsü Yû, the latter ran away. When Thang offered his to Wû Kwang, Wû Kwang became \nangry. When Kî Thâ \nheard it, he led his disciples, and withdrew to the river Kho, where \nthe feudal princes came and condoled with him, and after three years, Shän Thû-tî threw \nhimself into the water. Fishing-stakes are employed to catch fish; but when the fish \nare got, the men forget the stakes. Snares are employed to catch hares, but when the hares \nare got, men forget the snares. Words are employed to convey ideas; but when the ideas \nare apprehended, men forget the words. Fain would I talk with such a man who has forgot \nthe words!\n"

    "BOOK XXVII. YÜ YEN.": "\n1. Of my sentences nine in ten are metaphorical; of my illustrations seven in ten are \nfrom valued writers. The rest of my words are like the water that daily fills the cup, \ntempered and harmonised by the Heavenly element in our nature.\n\nThe nine sentences in ten which are metaphorical are borrowed from extraneous things to \nassist (the comprehension of) my argument. (When it is said, for instance), 'A father \ndoes not act the part of matchmaker for his own son,' (the meaning is that) 'it is better \nfor another man to praise the son than for his father to do so.' The use of such metaphorical \nlanguage is not my fault, but the fault of men (who would not otherwise readily understand \nme).\n\nMen assent to views which agree with their own, and oppose those which do not so agree. \nThose which agree with their own they hold to be right, and those which do not so agree \nthey hold to be wrong. The seven out of ten illustrations taken from valued writers are \ndesigned to put an end to disputations. Those writers are the men of hoary eld, my predecessors \nin time. But such as are unversed\n\nin the warp and woof, the beginning and end of the subject, cannot be set down as of venerable \neld, and regarded as the predecessors of others. If men have not that in them which fits \nthem to precede others, they are without the way proper to man, and they who are without \nthe way proper to man can only be pronounced defunct monuments of antiquity.\n\nWords like the water that daily issues from the cup, and are harmonised by the Heavenly \nElement (of our nature), may be carried on into the region of the unlimited, and employed \nto the end of our years. But without words there is an agreement (in principle). That \nagreement is not effected by words, and an agreement in words is not effected by it. Hence \nit is said, 'Let there be no words.' Speech does not need words. One may speak all his \nlife, and not have spoken a (right) word; and one may not have spoken all his life, and \nyet all his life been giving utterance to the (right) words. There is that which makes \na thing allowable, and that which makes a thing not allowable. There is that which makes \na thing right, and that which makes a thing not right. How is a thing right? It is right \nbecause it is right. How is a thing wrong? It is wrong because it is wrong. How is a thing \nallowable? It is allowable because it is so. How is a thing not allowable? It is not allowable \nbecause it is not so. Things indeed have what makes them right, and what makes them allowable. \nThere is nothing which has not its condition of right; nothing which has not its condition \nof allowability. But without the words of the (water-) cup in daily use, and harmonised \nby the Heavenly Element (in our\n\nnature), what one can continue long in the possession of these characteristics?\n\nAll things are divided into their several classes, and succeed to one another in the same \nway, though of different bodily forms. They begin and end as in an unbroken ring, though \nhow it is they do so be not apprehended. This is what is called the Lathe of Heaven; and \nthe Lathe of Heaven is the Heavenly Element in our nature.\n\n2. Kwang-dze said to Hui-Sze, 'When Confucius was in his sixtieth year, in that year his \nviews changed. \nWhat he had before held to be right, he now ended by holding to be wrong; \nand he did not know whether the things which he now pronounced to be right were not those \nwhich he had for fifty-nine years held to be wrong.' Hui-dze replied, 'Confucius with \nan earnest will pursued the acquisition of knowledge, and acted accordingly.' Kwang-dze \nrejoined, 'Confucius disowned such a course, and never said that it was his. He said, \n\"Man receives his powers from the Great Source (of his being), and he should restore \nthem to their (original) intelligence in his life. His singing should be in accordance \nwith the musical tubes, and his speech a model for imitation. When profit and righteousness \nare set before him, and his liking (for the latter) and dislike (of the\n\nformer), his approval and disapproval, are manifested, that only serves to direct the \nspeech of men (about him). To make men in heart submit, and not dare to stand up in opposition \nto him; to establish the fixed law for all under heaven:—ah! ah! I have not attained \nto that.\"'\n\n3. Zäng-dze twice took office, and on the two occasions his state of mind was different. \nHe said, 'While my parents were alive I took office, and though my emolument was only \nthree fû \n(of grain), my mind was happy. Afterwards when I took office, my emolument \nwas three thousand kung; \nbut I could not share it with my parents, and my mind was \nsad.' The other disciples asked Kung-nî, saying, 'Such an one as Shän may be pronounced \nfree from all entanglement:—is he to be blamed for feeling as he did?' The reply \nwas, 'But he was subject to entanglement. If he had been free from it, could he have \nhad that sadness? He would have looked on his three fû and three thousand kung no more \nthan on a heron or a mosquito passing before him.'\n\n4. Yen Khäng Dze-yû said to Tung-kwo, Dze-khî, 'When I (had begun to) hear your instructions, \nthe first year, I continued a simple rustic; the second\n\nyear, I became docile; the third year, I comprehended (your teaching); the fourth year, \nI was (plastic) as a thing; the fifth year, I made advances; the sixth year, the spirit \nentered (and dwelt in me); the seventh year, (my nature as designed by) Heaven was perfected; \nthe eighth year, I knew no difference between death and life; the ninth year, I attained \nto the Great Mystery.\n\n'Life has its work to do, and death ensues, (as if) the common character of each were \na thing prescribed. Men consider that their death has its cause; but that life from (the \noperation of) the Yang has no cause. But is it really so? How does (the Yang) operate \nin this direction? Why does it not operate there?\n\n'Heaven has its places and spaces which can be calculated; (the divisions of) the earth \ncan be assigned by men. But how shall we search for and find out (the conditions of the \nGreat Mystery)? We do not know when and how (life) will end, but how shall we conclude \nthat it is not determined (from without)? and as we do not know when and how it begins, \nhow should we conclude that it is not (so) determined?\n\n'In regard to the issues of conduct which we deem appropriate, how should we conclude \nthat there are no spirits presiding over them; and where those issues seem inappropriate, \nhow should we conclude that there are spirits presiding over them?'\n\n5. The penumbrae (once) asked the shadow, saying, 'Formerly you were looking down, \nand now you are looking up; formerly you had your hair tied up, and now it is dishevelled; \nformerly you were sitting, and now you have risen up; formerly you were walking, and now \nyou have stopped:—how is all this?' The shadow said, 'Venerable Sirs, how do you \nask me about such small matters? These things all belong to me, but I do not know how \nthey do so. I am (like) the shell of a cicada or the cast-off skin of a snake;—like \nthem, and yet not like them. With light and the sun I make my appearance; with darkness \nand the night I fade away. Am not I dependent on the substance from which I am thrown? \nAnd that substance is itself dependent on something else! When it comes, I come with it; \nwhen it goes, I go with it. When it comes under the influence of the strong Yang, I come \nunder the same. Since we are both produced by that strong Yang, what occasion is there \nfor you to question me?'\n\n6. Yang Dze-kü \nhad gone South to Phei, \nwhile Lâo Tan was travelling in the west \nin Khin. \n(He thereupon) asked (Lao-dze) to come to the border (of Phei), and went himself \nto Liang, where be met him. Lâo-dze stood in the middle of the way, and, looking up to \nheaven, said with a sigh, 'At first I thought that you might be taught, but now I see \nthat you cannot be.' Yang Dze-kü made no reply;\n\nand when they came to their lodging-house, he brought in water for the master to wash \nhis hands and rinse his mouth, along with a towel and comb. He then took off his shoes \noutside the door, went forward on his knees, and said, 'Formerly, your disciple wished \nto ask you, Master, (the reason of what you said); but you were walking, and there was \nno opportunity, and therefore I did not presume to speak. Now there is an opportunity, \nand I beg to ask why you spoke as you did.' Lâo-dze replied, 'Your eyes are lofty, and \nyou stare;—who would live with you? The purest carries himself as if he were soiled; \nthe most virtuous seems to feel himself defective.' Yang Dze-kü looked abashed and changed \ncountenance, saying, 'I receive your commands with reverence.'\n\nWhen he first went to the lodging-house, the people of it met him and went before him. \nThe master of it carried his mat for him, and the mistress brought the towel and comb. \nThe lodgers left their mats, and the cook his fire-place (as he passed them). When he \nwent away, the others in the house would have striven with him about (the places for) \ntheir mats.\n"

    "BOOK XXVIII. ZANG WANG.": "\n1. Yâo proposed to resign the throne to Hsü Yû, who would not accept it. He then offered \nit to Dze-kâu Kih-fû, \nbut he said, 'It is not unreasonable to propose that I should \noccupy the throne, but I happen to be suffering under a painful sorrow and illness. While \nI am engaged in dealing with it, I have not leisure to govern the kingdom.' Now the throne \nis the most important of all positions, and yet this man would not occupy it to the injury \nof his life; how much less would he have allowed any other thing to do so! But only he \nwho does not care to rule the kingdom is fit to be entrusted with it.\n\nShun proposed to resign the throne to Dze-kâu Kih-po, who declined in the very same \nterms as Kih-fû had done. Now the kingdom is the greatest of all concerns, and yet this \nman would not give his life in exchange for the throne. This shows how they who possess \nthe Tâo differ from common men.\n\nShun proposed to resign the throne to Shan Küan, who said, 'I am a unit in the midst \nof space and time. In winter I wear skins and furs; in summer, grass-cloth and linen; \nin spring I plough and sow, my strength being equal to the toil; in autumn I gather in \nmy harvest, and am prepared to cease from labour and eat. At sunrise I get up and work; \nat sunset I rest. So do I enjoy myself between heaven and earth, and my mind is content:—why \nshould I have anything to do with the throne? Alas! that you, Sir, do not know me better!' \nThereupon he declined the proffer, and went away, deep among the hills, no man knew where.\n\nShun proposed to resign the throne to his friend, a farmer of Shih-hû. The farmer, \nhowever, said (to himself), 'How full of vigour does our lord show himself, and how exuberant \nis his strength! If Shun with all his powers be not equal (to the task of government, \nhow should I be so?).' On this he took his wife on his back, led his son by the hand, \nand went away to the sea-coast, from which to the end of his life he did not come back.\n\nWhen Thâi-wang Than-fû \nwas dwelling in Pin, the wild tribes of the North attacked \nhim. He tried to serve them with skins and silks, but they were not satisfied. He tried \nto serve them with dogs and horses, but they were not satisfied, and then\n\nwith pearls and jade, but they were not satisfied. What they sought was his territory. \nThâi-wang Than-fû said (to his people), 'To dwell with the elder brother and cause the \nyounger brother to be killed, or with the father and cause the son to be killed,—this \nis what I cannot bear to do. Make an effort, my children, to remain here. What difference \nis there between being my subjects, or the subjects of those wild people? And I have heard \nthat a man does not use that which he employs for nourishing his people to injure them.' \nThereupon he took his staff and switch and left, but the people followed him in an unbroken \ntrain, and he established a (new) state at the foot of mount Khî. Thus Thâi-wang Than-fû \nmight be pronounced one who could give its (due) honour to life. Those who are able to \ndo so, though they may be rich and noble, will not, for that which nourishes them, injure \ntheir persons; and though they may be poor and mean, will not, for the sake of gain, involve \ntheir bodies (in danger). The men of the present age who occupy high offices and are of \nhonourable rank all lose these (advantages) again, and in the prospect of gain lightly \nexpose their persons to ruin:—is it not a case of delusion?\n\nThe people of Yüeh three times in succession killed their ruler, and the prince Sâu, \ndistressed by it, made his escape to the caves of Tan, so that Yüeh was left without a \nruler. The people sought\n\nfor the prince, but could not find him, till (at last) they followed him to the cave of \nTan. The prince was not willing to come out to them, but they smoked him out with moxa, \nand made him mount the royal chariot. As he took hold of the strap, and mounted the carriage, \nhe looked up to heaven, and called out, 'O Ruler, O Ruler, could you not have spared me \nthis?' Prince Sâu did not dislike being ruler;—he disliked the evil inseparable from \nbeing so. It may be said of him that he would not for the sake of a kingdom endanger his \nlife; and this indeed was the reason why the people of Yüeh wanted to get him for their \nruler.\n\n2. Han and Wei were contending about some territory which one of them had wrested \nfrom the other. Dze-hwâ Dze \nwent to see the marquis Kâo-hsî (of Han), and, finding \nhim looking sorrowful, said, 'Suppose now that all the states were to sign an agreement \nbefore you to the effect that \"Whoever should with his left hand carry off (the territory \nin dispute) should lose his right hand, and whoever should do so with his right hand should \nlose his left hand, but that, nevertheless, he who should carry it off was sure to obtain \nthe whole kingdom;\" would your lordship feel yourself able to carry it off?' The marquis \nsaid, 'I would not carry it off,' and Dze-hwâ rejoined, 'Very good. Looking at the thing \nfrom this point of view, your two arms are of more value to you than the whole kingdom. \nBut\n\nyour body is of more value than your two arms, and Han is of much less value than the \nwhole kingdom. The territory for which you are now contending is further much less important \nthan Han:—your lordship, since you feel so much concern for your body, should not \nbe endangering your life by indulging your sorrow.\n\nThe marquis Kâo-hsî said, 'Good! Many have given me their counsel about this matter; but \nI never heard what you have said.' Dze-hwâ Dze may be said to have known well what was \nof great importance and what was of little.\n\n3. The ruler of Lû, having heard that Yen Ho had attained to the Tâo, sent a messenger, \nwith a gift of silks, to prepare the way for further communication with him. Yen Ho was \nwaiting at the door of a mean house, in a dress of coarse hempen cloth, and himself feeding \na cow. When the \nmessenger arrived, Yen Ho himself confronted him. 'Is this,' said the \nmessenger, 'the house of Yen Ho?' 'It is,' was the reply; and the other was presenting \nthe silks to him, when he said, 'I am afraid you heard (your instructions) wrongly, and \nthat he who sent you will blame you. You had better make sure.' The messenger on this \nreturned, and made sure that he was right; but when he came back, and sought for Yen Ho, \nhe was not to be found.\n\nYes; men like Yen Ho do of a truth dislike riches and honours. Hence it is said, 'The \ntrue\n\nobject of the Tâo is the regulation of the person. Quite subordinate to this is its use \nin the management of the state and the clan; while the government of the kingdom is but \nthe dust and refuse of it.' From this we may see that the services of the Tîs and Kings \nare but a surplusage of the work of the sages, and do not contribute to complete the person \nor nourish the life. Yet the superior men of the present age will, most of them, throw \naway their lives for the sake of their persons, in pursuing their (material) objects;—is \nit not cause for grief? Whenever a sage is initiating any movement, he is sure to examine \nthe motive which influences him, and what he is about to do. Here, however, is a man, \nwho uses a pearl like that of the marquis of Sui to shoot a bird at a distance of 10,000 \nfeet. All men will laugh at him; and why? Because the thing which he uses is of great \nvalue, and what he wishes to get is of little. And is not life of more value than the \npearl of the marquis of Sui?\n\n4. Dze Lieh-dze was reduced to extreme poverty, and his person had a hungry look. \nA visitor mentioned the case to Dze-yang, (the premier) of Käng, saying, 'Lieh Yü-khâu, \nI believe, is a scholar who has attained to the Tâo. Is it because our ruler does not \nlove (such) scholars, that he should be living in his state in such poverty?' Dze-yang \nimmediately ordered an officer to send to him a supply of grain.\n\nWhen Lieh-dze saw the messenger, he bowed to him twice, and declined the gift, on which \nthe messenger went away. On Lieh-dze's going into the house, his wife looked to him and \nbeat her breast, saying, 'I have heard that the wife and children of a possessor of the \nTâo all enjoy plenty and ease, but now we look starved. The ruler has seen his error, \nand sent you a present of food, but you would not receive it;—is it appointed (for \nus to suffer thus)?' Dze Lieh-dze laughed and said to her, 'The ruler does not himself \nknow me. Because of what some one said to him, he sent me the grain; but if another speak \n(differently) of me to him, he may look on me as a criminal. This was why I did not receive \nthe grain.'\n\nIn the end it did come about, that the people, on an occasion of trouble and disorder, \nput Dze-yang to death.\n\n5. When king Kâo of Khû \nlost his kingdom, the sheep-butcher Yüeh followed him in his \nflight. When the king (recovered) his kingdom and returned to it, and was going to reward \nthose who had followed him, on coming to the sheep-butcher Yüeh, that personage said, \n'When our Great King lost his kingdom, I lost my sheep-killing. When his majesty got back \nhis kingdom, I also got back my sheep-killing. My income and rank have been recovered; \nwhy speak further of rewarding me?' The king, (on hearing of this reply), said, 'Force \nhim (to take the reward);' but Yüeh said, 'It was not through any crime of mine that the \nking lost his kingdom,\n\nand therefore I did not dare to submit to the death (which would have been mine if I had \nremained in the capital). And it was not through any service of mine that he recovered \nhis kingdom, and therefore I do not dare to count myself worthy of any reward from him.'\n\nThe king (now) asked that the butcher should be introduced to him, but Yüeh said, 'According \nto the law of Khû, great reward ought to be given to great service, and the recipient \nthen be introduced to the king; but now my wisdom was not sufficient to preserve the kingdom, \nnor my courage sufficient to die at the hands of the invaders. When the army of Wû entered, \nI was afraid of the danger, and got out of the way of the thieves;—it was not with \na distinct purpose (of loyalty) that I followed the king. And now he wishes, in disregard \nof the law, and violations of the conditions of our social compact, to see me in court;—this \nis not what I would like to be talked of through the kingdom.' The king said to Dze-khî, \nthe Minister of War, 'The position of the sheep-butcher Yüeh is low and mean, but his \nsetting forth of what is right is very high; do you ask him for me to accept the place \nof one of my three most distinguished nobles.' (This being communicated to Yüeh), he \nsaid, 'I know that the place of such a distinguished noble is nobler than a sheep-butcher's \nstall, and that the salary of 10,000 kung is more than its profits. But how should 1, \nthrough my greed of rank and emolument, bring on our ruler the name of an unlawful dispensation \nof his gifts? I dare not\n\nrespond to your wishes, but desire to return to my stall as the sheep-butcher.' Accordingly \nhe did not accept (the proffered reward).\n\n6. Yüan Hsien \nwas living in Lû. His house, whose walls were only a few paces round, \nlooked as if it were thatched with a crop of growing grass; its door of brushwood was \nincomplete, with branches of a mulberry tree for its side-posts; the window of each of \nits two apartments was formed by an earthenware jar (in the wall), which was stuffed with \nsome coarse serge. It leaked above, and was damp on the ground beneath; but there he sat \ncomposedly, playing on his guitar. Dze-kung, in an inner robe of purple and an outer one \nof pure white, riding in a carriage drawn by two large horses, the hood of which was too \nhigh to get into the lane (leading to the house), went to see him. Yüan Hsien, in a cap \nmade of bark, and slippers without heels, and with a stalk of hellebore for a staff, met \nhim at the door. 'Alas! Master,' said Dze-kung, 'that you should be in such distress!' \nYüan Hsien answered him, 'I have heard that to have no money is to be poor, and that not \nto be able to carry one's learning into practice is to be distressed. I am poor but not \nin distress.' Dze-kung shrank back, and looked ashamed, on which the other laughed and \nsaid, 'To act with a view to the world's (praise); to pretend to be public-spirited and \nyet be a partisan; to learn in order to please men; to teach for the sake of one's own \ngain; to conceal one's wickedness under the garb of\n\nbenevolence and righteousness; and to be fond of the show of chariots and horses:—these \nare things which Hsien cannot bear to do.'\n\nZäng-dze was residing in Wei. He wore a robe quilted with hemp, and had no outer garment; \nhis countenance looked rough and emaciated; his hands and feet were horny and callous; \nhe would be three days without lighting a fire; in ten years he did not have a new suit; \nif he put his cap on straight, the strings would break; if he drew tight the overlap of \nhis robe, his elbow would be seen; in putting on his shoes, the heels would burst them. \nYet dragging his shoes along, he sane, the 'Sacrificial Odes of Shang' with a voice that \nfilled heaven and earth as if it came from a bell or a sounding stone. The Son of Heaven \ncould not get him to be a minister; no feudal prince could get him for his friend. So \nit is that he who is nourishing his mind's aim forgets his body, and he who is nourishing \nhis body discards all thoughts of gain, and he who is carrying out the Tâo forgets his \nown mind.\n\nConfucius said to Yen Hui, 'Come here, Hui. Your family is poor, and your position is \nlow; why should you not take office?' Hui replied, 'I have no wish to be in office. Outside \nthe suburban district I possess fields to the extent of fifty acres, which are sufficient \nto supply me with congee; and inside it I have ten acres, which are sufficient to supply \nme with silk and flax. I find my pleasure in playing on my lute, and your doctrines, Master, \nwhich I study, are sufficient for my enjoyment; I do not wish to take office.' Confucius \nlooked sad, changed countenance, and said, \"How good is the mind of Hui! I have heard \nthat he who is contented\n\nwill not entangle himself with the pursuit of gain, that he who is conscious of having \ngained (the truth) in himself is not afraid of losing other things, and that he who cultivates \nthe path of inward rectification is not ashamed though he may have no official position. \nI have long been preaching this; but to-day I see it realised in Hui:—this is what \nI have gained.'\n\n7. Prince Mâu of \nKung-shan spoke to Kan-dze, saying, 'My body has its place by \nthe streams and near the sea, but my mind dwells at the court of Wei;—what have you \nto say to me in the circumstances?' Kan-dze replied, 'Set the proper value on your life. \nWhen one sets the proper value on his life, gain seems to him unimportant.' The prince \nrejoined, 'I know that, but I am not able to overcome (my Wishes).' The reply was, 'If \nyou cannot master yourself (in the matter), follow (your inclinations so that) your spirit \nmay not be dissatisfied. When you cannot master yourself, and try to force yourself where \nyour spirit does not follow, this is what is called doing yourself a double injury; and \nthose who so injure themselves are not among the long-lived.'\n\nMâu of Wei was the son of a lord of ten thousand chariots. For him to live in retirement \namong crags and caves was more difficult than for a scholar who had not worn the dress \nof office. Although he\n\nhad not attained to the Tâo, he maybe said to have had some idea of it.\n\n8. When Confucius was reduced to extreme distress between Khän and Zhâi, for seven days \nhe had no cooked meat to eat, but only some soup of coarse vegetables without any rice \nin it. His countenance wore the appearance of great exhaustion, and yet he kept playing \non his lute and singing inside the house. Yen Hui (was outside), selecting the vegetables, \nwhile Dze-la and Dze-kung were talking together, and said to him, 'The Master has twice \nbeen driven from Lû; he had to flee from Wei; the tree (beneath which he rested) was cut \ndown in Sung; he was reduced to extreme distress in Shang and Kâu; he is held in a state \nof siege here between Khän and Zhâi; any one who kills him will be held guiltless; there \nis no prohibition against making him a prisoner. And yet he keeps playing and singing, \nthrumming his lute without ceasing. Can a superior man be without the feeling of shame \nto such an extent as this?' Yen Hui gave them no reply, but went in and told (their words) \nto Confucius, who pushed aside his lute, and said, 'Yû and Zhze are small men. Call them \nhere, and I will explain the thing to them.'\n\nWhen they came in, Dze-lû said, 'Your present condition may be called one of extreme distress.' \nConfucius replied, 'What words are these! When the Superior man has free course with his \nprinciples, that is what we call his success; when such course is denied, that is what \nwe call his failure. Now I hold in my embrace the principles of benevolence and righteousness, \nand with them meet the evils of a disordered age;—where is the proof of my being\n\nin extreme distress? Therefore looking inwards and examining myself, I have no difficulties \nabout my principles; though I encounter such difficulties (as the present), I do not lose \nmy virtue. It is when winter's cold is come, and the hoar-frost and snow are falling, \nthat we know the vegetative power of the pine and cypress. This strait between Khän and \nZhâi is fortunate for me.' He then took back his lute so that it emitted a twanging sound, \nand began to play and sing. (At the same time) Dze-lû, hurriedly, seized a shield, and \nbegan to dance, while Dze-kung said, 'I did not know (before) the height of heaven nor \nthe depth of the earth.'\n\nThe ancients who had got the Tâo were happy when reduced to extremity, and happy when \nhaving free course. Their happiness was independent of both these conditions. The Tâo \nand its characteristics!—let them have these and distress and success come to them \nas cold and heat, as wind and rain in the natural order of things. Thus it was that Hsü \nYû found pleasure on the north of the river Ying, and that the earl of Kung enjoyed himself \non the top of mount (Kung).\n\n9. Shun proposed to resign the throne to his friend, the Northerner Wû-kâi, who said, \n'A strange man you are, O sovereign! You (first) lived among the channeled fields, and \nthen your\n\nplace was in the palace of Yâo. And not only so:—you now further wish to extend to \nme the stain of your disgraceful doings. I am ashamed to see you. And on this he threw \nhimself into the abyss of Khing-läng.\n\nWhen Thang was about to attack Kieh, he took counsel with Pien Sui, who said, 'It is no \nbusiness of mine.' Thang then said, 'To whom should I apply?' And the other said, 'I do \nnot know.' Thang then took counsel with Wû Kwang, who gave the same answer as Pien Sui; \nand when asked to whom he should apply, said in the same way, 'I do not know.' 'Suppose,' \nThang then said, 'I apply to Î Yin, what do you say about him?' The reply was, 'He has \na wonderful power in doing what is disgraceful, and I know nothing more about him!'\n\nThang thereupon took counsel with Î Yin, attacked Kieh, and overcame him, after which \nhe proposed to resign the throne to Pien Sui, who declined it, saying, 'When you were \nabout to attack Kieh, and sought counsel from me, you must have supposed me to be prepared \nto be a robber. Now that you have conquered Kieh, and propose to resign the throne to \nme, you must consider me to be greedy. I have been born in an age of disorder, and a man \nwithout principle twice comes, and tries to extend to me the stain of his disgraceful \nproceedings!—I cannot bear to hear the repetition of his proposals.' With this he \nthrew himself into the Kâu \nwater and died.\n\nThang further made proffer of the throne to Wû Kwang, saying, 'The wise man has planned \nit; the martial man has carried it through; and the benevolent man should occupy it:—this \nwas the method of antiquity. Why should you, Sir, not take the position?' Wû Kwang refused \nthe proffer, saying, 'To depose the sovereign is contrary to right; to kill the people \nis contrary to benevolence. When another has encountered the risks, if I should accept \nthe gain of his adventure, I should violate my disinterestedness. I have heard it said, \n\"If it be not right for him to do so, one should not accept the emolument; in an age of \nunprincipled (government), one should not put foot on the soil (of the) country:\"—how \nmuch less should I accept this position of honour! I cannot bear to see you any longer.' \nAnd with this he took a stone oil his back, and drowned himself in the Lü water.\n\n10. Formerly, at the rise of the Kâu dynasty, there were two brothers who lived in Kû-kû, \nand were named Po-î and Shû-khî. They spoke together and said, 'We have heard that in \nthe west there is one who seems to rule according to the Right Way; let us go and see.' \n(Accordingly) they came to the south of (mount) Khî; and when king Wû heard of them, he \nsent (his brother) Shû Tan to see them, and make a covenant with them, engaging that their \nwealth should be second (only to that of the king), and that their offices should be of \nthe first rank,\n\nand instructing him to bury the covenant with the blood of the victim after they had smeared \nthe corners of their mouths with it. The brothers looked at each other and laughed, \nsaying, 'Ah! How strange! This is not what we call the Right Way. Formerly, when Shän \nNäng had the kingdom, he offered his sacrifices at the proper seasons and with the utmost \nreverence, but without praying for any blessing. Towards men he was leal-hearted and sincere, \ndoing his utmost in governing them, but without seeking anything for himself When it was \nhis pleasure to use administrative measures, he did so; and a sterner rule when he thought \nthat would be better. He did not by the ruin of others establish his own power; he did \nnot exalt himself by bringing others low; he did not, when the time was opportune, seek \nhis own profit. But now Kâu, seeing the disorder of Yin, has suddenly taken the government \ninto its hands; with the high it has taken counsel, and with those below employed bribes; \nit relies on its troops to maintain the terror of its might; it makes covenants over victims \nto prove its good faith; it vaunts its proceedings to please the masses; it kills and \nattacks for the sake of gain:—this is simply overthrowing disorder and changing it \nfor tyranny. We have heard that the officers of old, in an age of good government, did \nnot shrink from their duties, and in an age of disorder did not recklessly seek to remain \nin office. Now the kingdom is in a state of darkness; the virtue of Kâu is decayed. Than \nto join with it and\n\nlay our persons in the dust, it is better for us to abandon it, and maintain the purity \nof our conduct.'\n\nThe two princes then went north to the hill of Shâu-yang, where they died of starvation. \nIf men such as they, in the matter of riches and honours, can manage to avoid them, (let \nthem do so); but they must not depend on their lofty virtue to pursue any perverse course, \nonly gratifying their own tendencies, and not doing service in their time:—this was \nthe style of these two princes.\n"

    "BOOK XXIX. TÂO KIH.": "\n1. Confucius was on terms of friendship with Liû-hsîa Kî, who had a brother named Tâo \nKih. This Tâo Kih had 9,000 followers, who marched at their will through the kingdom, \nassailing and oppressing the different princes. They dug through walls and broke into \nhouses; they drove away people's cattle and horses; they carried off people's wives and \ndaughters. In their greed to get, they forgot the claims of kinship, and paid no regard \nto their parents and brethren. They did not sacrifice to their ancestors. Wherever they \npassed through the country, in the larger states the people guarded their city walls, \nand in the smaller the people took to their strongholds. All were distressed by them.\n\nConfucius spoke to Liû-hsiâ Kî, saying, 'Fathers should be able to lay down the law to \ntheir sons,\n\nand elder to instruct their younger brothers. If they are unable to do so, they do not \nfulfil the duties of the relationships which they sustain. You, Sir, are one of the most \ntalented officers of the age, and your younger brother is this Robber Kih. He is a pest \nin the kingdom, and you are not able to instruct him better; I cannot but be ashamed of \nyou, and I beg to go for you and give him counsel.' Liû-hsiâ Kî replied, 'You say, Sir, \nthat fathers must be able to lay down the law to their sons, and elder to instruct their \nyounger brothers, but if sons will not listen to the orders of their fathers, nor the \nyounger receive the lessons of their elder brothers, though one may have your powers of \npersuasion, what is to be done? And, moreover, Kih is a man whose mind is like a gushing \nfountain, and his will like a whirlwind; he is strong enough to resist all enemies, and \nclever enough to gloss over his wrong-doings. If you agree with him, he is glad; if you \noppose him, he is enraged; and he readily meets men with the language of abuse. You must \nnot go to him.'\n\nConfucius, however, did not attend to this advice. With Yen Hui as his charioteer, and \nDze-kung seated on the right, he went to see Tâo Kih, whom he found with his followers \nhalted on the south of Thâi-shan, and mincing men's livers, which he gave them to eat. \nConfucius alighted from his carriage, and went forward, till he saw the usher, to whom \nhe said, 'I, Khung Khiû of Lî, have heard of the general's lofty righteousness,' bowing \ntwice respectfully to the man as he said so. The usher went in and announced the visitor. \nBut when Tâo Kih heard of the arrival, he flew into a great\n\nrage; his eyes became like blazing stars, and his hair rose up and touched his cap. 'Is \nnot this fellow,' said he, 'Khung Khiû, that artful hypocrite of Lû? Tell him from me, \n\"You invent speeches and babble away, appealing without ground to (the examples of) Wän \nand Wû The ornaments on your cap are as many as the branches of a tree, and your girdle \nis (a piece of skin) from the ribs of a dead ox. The more you talk, the more nonsense \nyou utter. You get your food without (the labour of) ploughing, and your clothes without \n(that of) weaving. You wag your lips and make your tongue a drum-stick. You arbitrarily \ndecide what is right and what is wrong, thereby leading astray the princes throughout \nthe kingdom, and making its learned scholars not occupy their thoughts with their proper \nbusiness. You recklessly set up your filial piety and fraternal duty, and curry favour \nwith the feudal princes, the wealthy and the noble. Your offence is great; your crime \nis very heavy. Take yourself off home at once. If you do not do so, I will take your liver, \nand add it to the provision for to-day's food.\"'\n\nBut Confucius sent in another message, saying, I enjoy the good will of (your brother) \nKî, and I wish and hope to tread the ground beneath your tent.' When the usher had \ncommunicated this message, Tâo Kih said, 'Make him come forward.' On this Confucius hastened \nforwards. Declining to take a mat, he drew hastily back, and bowed twice to Tâo Kih, who \nin a great rage stretched\n\nhis legs apart, laid his hand on his sword, and with glaring eyes and a voice like the \ngrowl of a nursing tigress, said, 'Come forwards, Khiû. If what you say be in accordance \nwith my mind, you shall live; but, if it be contrary to it, you shall die.' Confucius \nreplied, 'I have heard that everywhere under the sky there are three (most excellent) \nqualities. To be naturally tall and large, to be elegant and handsome without a peer, \nso that young and old, noble and mean, are pleased to look upon him;—this is the \nhighest of those qualities. To comprehend both heaven and earth in his wisdom, and to \nbe able to speak eloquently on all subjects;—this is the middle one of them. To be \nbrave and courageous, resolute and daring, gathering the multitudes round him, and leading \non his troops;—this is the lowest of them. Whoever possesses one of these qualities \nis fit to stand with his face to the south, and style himself a Prince. But you, General, \nunite in yourself all the three. Your person is eight cubits and two inches in height; \nthere is a brightness about your face and a light in your eyes; your lips look as if stained \nwith vermilion; your teeth are like rows of precious shells; your voice is attuned to \nthe musical tubes, and yet you are named \"The Robber Kih.\" I am ashamed of you, General, \nand cannot approve of you. If you are inclined to listen to me, I should like to go as \nyour commissioner to Wû and Yüeh in the south; to Khî and Lû in the north; to Sung and \nWei in the east; and to Zin and Khû in the west. I will get them to build for you a great \ncity several hundred lî in size, to\n\nestablish under it towns containing several hundred thousands of inhabitants, and honour \nyou there as a feudal lord. The kingdom will see you begin your career afresh; you will \ncease from your wars and disband your soldiers; you will collect and nourish your brethren, \nand along with them offer the sacrifices to your ancestors:—this will be a course \nbefitting a sage and an officer of ability, and will fulfil the wishes of the whole kingdom.'\n\n'Come forward, Khiû,' said Tâo Kih, greatly enraged. 'Those who can be persuaded by considerations \nof gain, and to whom remonstrances may be addressed with success, are all ignorant, low, \nand ordinary people. That I am tall and large, elegant and handsome, so that all who see \nme are pleased with me;—this is an effect of the body left me by my parents. Though \nyou were not to praise me for it, do I not know it myself? And I have heard that he who \nlikes to praise men to their face will also like to speak ill of them behind their back. \nAnd when you tell me of a great wall and a multitudinous people, this is to try to persuade \nme by considerations of gain, and to cocker me as one of the ordinary people. But how \ncould such advantages last for long? Of all great cities there is none so great as the \nwhole kingdom, which was possessed by Yâo and Shun, while their descendants (now) have \nnot so much territory as would admit an awl. Thang and Wa were both set up as the Sons \nof Heaven, but in after ages (their posterity) were cut\n\noff and extinguished;—was not this because the gain of their position was so great \na prize?\n\n'And moreover I have heard that anciently birds and beasts were numerous, and men were \nfew, so that they lived in nests in order to avoid the animals. In the daytime they gathered \nacorns and chestnuts, and in the night they roosted on the trees; and on account of this \nthey are called the people of the Nest-builder. Anciently the people did not know the \nuse of clothes. In summer they collected great stores of faggots, and in winter kept themselves \nwarm by means of them; and on account of this they are called the people who knew how \nto take care of their lives. In the age of Shän Näng, the people lay down in simple innocence, \nand rose up in quiet security. They knew their mothers, but did not know their fathers. \nThey dwelt along with the elks and deer. They ploughed and ate; they wove and made clothes; \nthey had no idea of injuring one another:—this was the grand time of Perfect virtue. \nHwang-Tî, however, was not able to perpetuate this virtuous state. He fought with Khih-yû \nin the wild of Ko-lû \ntill the blood flowed over a hundred lî. When Yâo and Shun arose, \nthey instituted their crowd of ministers. Thang banished his lord. King Wû killed Kâu. \nSince that time the strong have oppressed the weak, and the many tyrannised over the few. \nFrom Thang and Wû downwards, (the\n\nrulers) have all been promoters of disorder and confusion. You yourself now cultivate \nand inculcate the ways of Wän and Wû; you handle whatever subjects are anywhere discussed \nfor the instruction of future ages. With your peculiar robe and narrow girdle, with your \ndeceitful speech and hypocritical conduct, you delude the lords of the different states, \nand are seeking for riches and honours. There is no greater robber than you are;—why \ndoes not all the world call you the Robber Khiû, instead of styling me the Robber Kih?\n\n'You prevailed by your sweet speeches on Dze-lû, and made him your follower; you made \nhim put away his high cap, lay aside his long sword, and receive your instructions, so \nthat all the world said, \"Khung Khiû is able to arrest violence and repress the wrong-doer;\" \nbut in the end, when Dze-lû wished to slay the ruler of Wei, and the affair proved unsuccessful, \nhis body was exhibited in pickle over the eastern gate of the capital;—so did your \nteaching of him come to nothing.\n\n'Do you call yourself a scholar of talent, a sage? Why, you were twice driven out of Lû; \nyou had to run away from Wei; you were reduced to extremity in Khî; you were held in a \nstate of siege between Khän and Zhâi; there is no resting-place for your person in the \nkingdom; your instructions brought Dze-lû to pickle. Such have been the misfortunes (attending \nyour course). You have done no good either for yourself or for others;—how can your \ndoctrines be worth being thought much of?\n\n'There is no one whom the world exalts so much as it does Hwang-Tî, and still he was not \nable to perfect his virtue, but fought in the wilderness of\n\nKo-lû, till the blood flowed over a hundred lî. Yâo was not kind to his son. Shun was \nnot filial. \nYü was paralysed on one side. Thang banished his sovereign. King Wû \nsmote Kâu. King Wän was imprisoned in Yû-lî. These are the six men of whom the world \nthinks the most highly, yet when we accurately consider their history, we see that for \nthe sake of gain they all disallowed their true (nature), and did violence to its proper \nqualities and tendencies:—their conduct cannot be thought of but with deep shame.\n\n'Among those whom the world calls men of ability and virtue were (the brothers) Po-Î and \nShû-khî. They declined the rule of Kû-kû, and died of starvation on the hill of Shâu-yang, \nleaving their bones and flesh unburied. Pâo Ziâo vaunted his conduct, and condemned the \nworld, but he died with his arms round a tree. When Shän-thû Tî's remonstrances were \nnot listened to, he fastened a stone on his back, and threw himself into the Ho, where \nhe was eaten by the fishes and turtles. Kieh Dze-thui was the most devoted (of followers), \nand cut a piece from his thigh as food for duke Wän. But when the duke afterwards overlooked \nhim (in\n\nhis distribution of favours), he was angry, and went away, and was burned to death with \na tree in his arms. \nWei Shäng had made an appointment with a girl to meet him under \na bridge; but when she did not come, and the water rose around him, he would not go away, \nand died with his arms round one of the pillars. (The deaths of) these four men were \nnot different from those of the dog that is torn in pieces, the pig that is borne away \nby a current, or the beggar (drowned in a ditch) with his alms-gourd in his hand. They \nwere all caught as in a net by their (desire for) fame, not caring to nourish their life \nto its end, as they were bound to do.\n\n'Among those whom the world calls faithful ministers there have been none like the prince \nPî-kan and Wû Dze-hsü. But Dze-hsü's (dead) body was cast into the Kiang, and the heart \nof Pî-kan was cut out. These two were what the world calls loyal ministers, but the end \nhas been that everybody laughs at them. Looking at all the above cases, down to those \nof Dze-hsü and Pî-kan, there is not one worthy to be honoured; and as to the admonitions \nwhich you, Khiû, wish to impress on me, if you tell me about the state of the dead, I \nam unable to know anything about it; if you tell me about the things of men (alive), they \nare only such as I have stated, what I have heard and know all about. I will now tell \nyou, Sir, my views about the condition of man. The eyes wish to look on beauty; the cars \nto hear music; the mouth to enjoy flavours; the will to be gratified. The greatest longevity \nman\n\ncan reach is a hundred years; a medium longevity is eighty years; the lowest longevity \nis sixty. Take away sickness, pining, bereavement, mourning, anxieties, and calamities, \nthe times when, in any of these, one can open his mouth and laugh, are only four or five \ndays in a month. Heaven and earth have no limit of duration, but the death of man has \nits (appointed) time. Take the longest amount of a limited time, and compare it with what \nis unlimited, its brief existence is not different from the passing of a crevice by one \nof king Mû's horses. \nThose who cannot gratify their will and natural aims, and nourish \ntheir appointed longevity, are all unacquainted with the (right) Way (of life). I cast \nfrom me, Khiû, all that you say. Be quick and go. Hurry back and say not a word more. \nYour Way is only a wild recklessness, deceitful, artful, vain, and hypocritical. It is \nnot available to complete the true (nature of man); it is not worth talking about!'\n\nConfucius bowed twice, and hurried away. He went out at the door, and mounted his carriage. \nThrice he missed the reins as he tried to take hold of them. His eyes were dazed, and \nhe could not see; and his colour was that of slaked lime. He laid hold of the cross-bar, \nholding his head down, and unable to draw his breath. When he got back, outside the east \ngate of (the capital of) Lû, he encountered Liû-hsiâ Kî, who said to him, 'Here you are, \nright in the gate. For some days I have not seen you. Your carriage and horses are travel-stained;—have \nyou not been to see Tâo Kih?' Confucius\n\nlooked up to heaven, sighed, and said, 'Yes.' The other went on, 'And did he not set himself \nin opposition to all your views, as I said he would do?' 'He did. My case has been that \nof the man who cauterised himself without being ill. I rushed away, stroked the tiger's \nhead, played with his whiskers, and narrowly escaped his mouth.'\n\n2. Dze-kang \nasked Mân Kâu-the, \nsaying, 'Why do you not pursue a (righteous) course? \nWithout such a course you will not be believed in; unless you are believed in, you will \nnot be employed in office; and if not employed in office, you will not acquire gain. Thus, \nif you look at the matter from the point of reputation, or estimate it from the point \nof gain, a righteous course is truly the right thing. If you discard the thought of reputation \nand gain, yet when you think over the thing in your own mind, you will see that the scholar \nshould not be a single day without pursuing a (righteous) course.' Man Kau-teh said, 'He \nwho has no shame becomes rich, and he in whom many believe becomes illustrious. Thus the \ngreatest fame and gain would seem to spring from being without shame and being believed \nin. Therefore if you look at the matter from the point of reputation, or estimate it from \nthe point of gain, to be believed in is the right thing. If you discard the thought of \nfame and gain, and think over the thing in your own mind, you will see that the scholar \nin the course which he pursues is (simply) holding fast his Heavenly (nature, and gaining \nnothing).'\n\nDze-kang said, 'Formerly Kieh and Kâu each enjoyed the honour of being the sovereign, \nand all the wealth of the kingdom was his; but if you now say to a (mere) money-grabber, \n\"Your conduct is like that of Kieh or Kâu,\" he will look ashamed, and resent the imputation:—(these \ntwo sovereigns) are despised by the smallest men. Kung-nî and Mo Tî (on the other hand) \nwere poor, and common men; but if you say to a Prime Minister that his conduct is like \nthat of Kung-nî or Mo Tî, then he will be put out and change countenance, and protest \nthat he is not worthy (to be so spoken of):—(these two philosophers) are held to \nbe truly noble by (all) scholars. Thus it is that the position of sovereign does not necessarily \nconnect with being thought noble, nor the condition of being poor and of common rank with \nbeing thought mean. The difference of being thought noble or mean arises from the conduct \nbeing good or bad.' Mân Kâu-teh replied, 'Small robbers are put in prison; a great robber \nbecomes a feudal lord; and in the gate of the feudal lord your righteous scholars will \nbe found. For instance, Hsiâo-po, the duke Hwan, killed his elder brother, and took \nhis sister-in-law to himself, and yet Kwan Kung became his minister; and Thien Khang, \nstyled Khäng-dze, killed his ruler, and usurped the state, and yet Confucius received \na present of silks from him. In their discussions they would condemn the men, but\n\nin their conduct they abased themselves before them. In this way their words and actions \nmust have been at war together in their breasts;—was it not a contradiction and perversity? \nAs it is said in a book, \"Who is bad? and who is good? The successful is regarded as the \nHead, and the unsuccessful as the Tail.\"\n\nDze-kang said, 'If you do not follow the usual course of what is held to be right, but \nobserve no distinction between the near and remote degrees of kin, no difference between \nthe noble and the mean, no order between the old and the young, then how shall a separation \nbe made of the fivefold arrangement (of the virtues), and the six parties (in the social \norganisation)?' Mân Kâu-teh replied, 'Yâo killed his eldest son, and Shun banished his \nhalf-brother:—did \nthey observe the rules about the different degrees of kin? Thang \ndeposed Kieh; king Wa overthrew Kâu:—did they observe the righteousness that should \nobtain between the noble and the mean? King Kî took the place of his elder brother, \nand the duke of Kâu killed his:—did they observe the order that should obtain \nbetween the elder and the younger? The Literati make hypocritical speeches; the followers \nof Mo hold that all should be loved equally:—do we find in them the separation of \nthe fivefold arrangement (of the\n\nvirtues), and \nthe six parties (in the social organisation)? And further, you, Sir, \nare all for reputation, and I am all for gain; but where the actual search for reputation \nand gain may not be in accordance with principle and will not bear to be examined in the \nlight of the right way, let me and you refer the matter to-morrow to the decision of \nWû-yo.'\n\n(This Wû-yo) said, 'The small man pursues after wealth; the superior man pursues after \nreputation. The way in which they change their feelings and alter their nature is different; \nbut if they were to cast away what they do, and replace it with doing nothing, they would \nbe the same. Hence it is said, \"Do not be a small man;—return and pursue after the \nHeavenly in you. Do not be a superior man;—follow the rule of the Heavenly in you. \nBe it crooked, be it straight, view the thing in the light of Heaven as revealed in you. \nLook all round on every side of it, and as the time indicates, cease your endeavours. \nBe it right, be it wrong, hold fast the ring in yourself in which all conditions converge. \nAlone by yourself, carry out your idea; ponder over the right way. Do not turn your course; \ndo not try to complete your righteousness. You will fail in what you do. Do not haste \nto be rich; do not follow after your perfection. If you do, you will lose the heavenly \nin you.\"\n\n'Pî-kan had his heart cut out; Dze-hsü had his eyes gouged out:—such were the evil \nconsequences of their loyalty. The upright person bore witness against his father; \nWei Shäng was drowned:—such were the misfortunes of good faith. Pao-dze stood till \nhe was dried up; Shän-dze would not defend himself:—such were the injuries brought \non by disinterestedness. Confucius did not see his mother; Khwang-dze did not see \nhis father:—such were the failures of the righteous. These are instances handed down \nfrom former ages, and talked about in these later times. They show us how superior men, \nin their determination to be correct in their words and resolute in their conduct, paid \nthe penalty of these misfortunes, and were involved in these distresses.'\n\n3. Mr. Dissatisfied, asked Mr.\nKnow-the-Mean, saying, 'There is no man after all \nwho does not strive for reputation and pursue after gain. When men are rich, then others \ngo to them. Going to them, they put themselves beneath them. In that position they do \nhonour to them as nobler than themselves. But to\n\nsee others taking that position and doing honour to us is the way to prolong life, and \nto secure the rest of the body and the satisfaction of the mind. You alone, Sir, however, \nhave no idea of this. Is it that your knowledge is deficient? Is it that you have the \nknowledge, but want the strength to carry it into practice? Or is it that your mind is \nmade up to do what you consider right, and never allow yourself to forget it?' Know-the-Mean \nreplied, 'Here now is this man judging of us, his contemporaries, and living in the same \nneighbourhood as himself, that we consider ourselves scholars who have abjured all vulgar \nways and risen above the world. He is entirely without the thought of submitting to the \nrule of what is right. He therefore studies ancient times and the present, and the differing \nquestions about the right and wrong, and agrees with the vulgar ideas and influences of \nthe age, abandoning what is most important and discarding what is most honourable, in \norder to be free to act as he does. But is he not wide of the mark when he thinks that \nthis is the way to promote long life, and to secure the rest of the body and the satisfaction \nof the mind? He has his painful afflictions and his quiet repose, but he does not inquire \nhow his body is so variously affected; he has his apprehensive terrors, and his happy \njoys, but he does not inquire how his mind has such different experiences. He knows how \nto pursue his course, but he does not know why he does so. Even if he had the dignity \nof the Son of Heaven, and all the wealth of the kingdom were his, he would not be beyond \nthe reach of misfortunes and evils.' Dissatisfied rejoined, 'But riches are in every way \nadvantageous to man.\n\nWith them his attainment of the beautiful and mastery of every art become what the perfect \nman cannot obtain nor the sagely man reach to; his appropriation of the bravery and strength \nof others enables him to exercise a powerful sway; his availing himself of the wisdom \nand plans of others makes him be accounted intelligent and discriminating; his taking \nadvantage of the virtues of others makes him be esteemed able and good. Though he may \nnot be the holder of a state, he is looked to with awe as a ruler and father. Moreover, \nmusic, beauty, with the pleasures of the taste and of power, are appreciated by men's \nminds and rejoiced in without any previous learning of them; the body reposes in them \nwithout waiting for the example of others. Desire and dislike, avoidance and pursuit, \ndo not require any master;—this is the nature of man. Though the world may condemn \none's indulgence of them, who can refrain from it?' Know-the-Mean replied, 'The action \nof the wise is directed for the good of the people, but they do not go against the (proper) \nrule and degree. Therefore when they have enough, they do not strive (for more); they \nhave no further object, and so they do not seek for one. When they have not enough, they \nwill seek for it; they will strive for it in every quarter, and yet not think of themselves \nas greedy. If they have (already) a superfluity, they will decline (any more); they will \ndecline the throne, and yet not think of themselves as disinterested:—the conditions \nof disinterestedness and greediness are (with them) not from the constraint of anything \nexternal. Through their exercise of introspection, their power may be that of the sovereign, \nbut they will not in\n\ntheir nobility be arrogant to others; their wealth may be that of the whole kingdom, but \nthey will not in their possession of it make a mock of others. They estimate the evils \nto which they are exposed, and are anxious about the reverses which they may experience. \nThey think how their possessions may be injurious to their nature, and therefore they \nwill decline and not accept them;—but not because they seek for reputation and praise.\n\n'Yâo and Shun were the sovereigns, and harmony prevailed. It did so, not because of their \nbenevolence towards the people;—they would not, for what was (deemed) admirable, \ninjure their lives. Shan Küan and Hsü Yû might have been the sovereigns, but they would \nnot receive the throne;—not that they declined it without purpose, but they would \nnot by its occupancy injure themselves. These all followed after what was advantageous \nto them, and declined what was injurious, and all the world celebrates their superiority. \nThus, though they enjoy the distinction, they did what they did, not for the sake of the \nreputation and praise.'\n\nDissatisfied (continued his argument), saying, 'In thus thinking it necessary for their \nreputation, they bitterly distressed their bodies, denied themselves what was pleasant, \nand restricted themselves to a bare sustenance in order to sustain their life; but so \nthey had life-long distress, and long-continued pressure till their death arrived.' Know-the-Mean \nreplied, 'Tranquil ease is happiness; a superfluity is injurious:—so it is with all \nthings, and especially it is so, where the superfluity is of wealth. The ears of the rich \nare provided with the music of bells, drums, flageolets and flutes; and their mouths are\n\nstuffed with the flesh of fed beasts and with wine of the richest flavour; so are their \ndesires satisfied, till they forget their proper business:—theirs may be pronounced \na condition of disorder. Sunk deeply in their self-sufficiency, they resemble individuals \nascending a height with a heavy burden on their backs:—their condition may be pronounced \none of bitter suffering. They covet riches, thinking to derive comfort from them; they \ncovet power, and would fain monopolise it; when quiet and retired, they are drowned in \nluxurious indulgence; their persons seem to shine, and they are full of boasting:—they \nmay be said to be in a state of disease. In their desire to be rich and striving for gain, \nthey fill their stores, and, deaf to all admonition, refuse to desist from their course. \nThey are even more elated, and hold on their way:—their conduct may be pronounced \ndisgraceful. When their wealth is amassed till they cannot use it, they clasp it to their \nbreasts and will not part with it; when their hearts are distressed with their very fulness, \nthey still seek for more and will not desist:—their condition may be said to be sad. \nIn-doors they are apprehensive of pilfering and begging thieves, and out-of-doors they \nare afraid of being injured by plundering robbers; in-doors they have many chambers and \npartitions, and out-of-doors they do not dare to go alone:—they may be said to be \nin a state of (constant) alarm.\n\n'These six conditions are the most deplorable in the world, but they forget them all, \nand have lost their faculty of judgment. When the evil comes, though they begged it with \nall the powers of their nature, and by the sacrifice of all their wealth, they could\n\nnot bring back one day of untroubled peace. When they look for their reputation, it is \nnot to be seen; when they seek for their wealth, it is not to be got. To task their thoughts, \nand destroy their bodies, striving for (such an end as) this;—is it not a case of \ngreat delusion?'\n"

    "BOOK XXX. YÜEH KIEN.": "\nFormerly, king Wän of Kâo \ndelighted in the sword-fight. More than three thousand men, \nmasters of the weapon, appeared as his guests, lining the way on either side of his gate, \nand fighting together before him day and night. Over a hundred of them would die or be \n(severely) wounded in the course of a year, but he was never weary of looking on (at their \nengagements), so fond was he of them. The thing continued for three years, when the kingdom \nbegan to decay, and other states to plan measures against it.\n\nThe crown-prince Khwei \nwas distressed, and laid the case before his attendants, saying, \n'If any one can persuade the king, and put an end to these swordsmen, I will give him \na thousand ounces of\n\nsilver.' His attendants said, '(Only) Kwang-dze is able to do this.' Thereupon the prince \nsent men with a thousand ounces of silver to offer to Kwang-dze, who, however, would not \naccept them, but went with the messengers. When he saw the prince, he said, 'O prince, \nwhat have you to say to Kâu, and why would you give me the silver?' The prince replied, \n'I have heard that you, master, are sagacious and sage. I sent you respectfully the thousand \nounces of silver, as a prelude to the silks and other gifts. But as you decline to receive \nthem, how dare I now tell you (what I wished from you)?' Kwang-dze rejoined, 'I have heard, \nO prince, that what you wanted me for was to wean the king from what is his delight. Suppose \nthat in trying to persuade his Majesty I should offend him, and not fulfil your expectation, \nI shall be punished with death;—and could I then enjoy this silver? Or suppose that \nI shall succeed in persuading his Majesty, and accomplish what you desire, what is there \nin the kingdom of Kâo that I might ask for which I would not get?'\n\nThe crown-prince said, 'Yes; but my (father), the king, will see none but swordsmen.' \nKwang-dze replied, 'I know; but I am expert in the use of the sword.' 'That is well,' \nobserved the prince; 'but the swordsmen whom his Majesty sees all have their hair in a \ntangle, with whiskers projecting out. They wear slouching caps with coarse and unornamented \ntassels, and their coats are cut short behind. They have staring eyes, and talk about \nthe hazards of\n\ntheir game. The king is delighted with all this; but now you are sure to present yourself \nto him in your scholar's dress, and this will stand greatly in the way of your success.'\n\nKwang-dze said, 'I will then, with your leave, get me a swordsman's dress.' This was ready \nin three days, and when he appeared in it before the prince, the latter went with him \nto introduce him to the king, who then drew his sword from its scabbard and waited for \nhim. When Kwang-dze entered the door of the hall, he did not hurry forward, nor, when \nhe saw the king, did he bow. The king asked him, 'What do you want to teach me, Sir, that \nyou have got the prince to mention you beforehand?' The reply was, 'I have heard that \nyour Majesty is fond of the sword-fight, and therefore I have sought an interview with \nyou on the ground of (my skill in the use of) the sword.' 'What can you do with your sword \nagainst an opponent?' 'Let me meet with an opponent every ten paces, my sword would deal \nwith him, so that I should not be stopped in a march of a thousand lî.' The king was delighted \nwith him, and said, 'You have not your match in the kingdom.' Kwang-dze replied, 'A good \nswordsman first makes a feint (against his opponent), then seems to give him an advantage, \nand finally gives his thrust, reaching him before he can return the blow. I should like \nto have an opportunity to show you my skill.' The king said, 'Stop (for a little), Master. \nGo to your lodging, and wait for my orders. I will make arrangements for the play, and \nthen call you.'\n\nThe king accordingly made trial of his swordsmen for seven days, till more than sixty \nof them were\n\nkilled, or (severely) wounded. He then selected five or six men, and made them bring their \nswords and take their places beneath the hall, after which he called Kwang-dze, and said \nto him, 'To-day I am going to make (you and) these men show what you can do with your \nswords.' 'I have long been looking for the opportunity,' replied Kwang-dze. The king then \nasked him what would be the length of the sword which he would use; and he said, 'Any \nlength will suit me, but I have three swords, any one of which I will use, as may please \nyour Majesty. Let me first tell you of them, and then go to the arena.' 'I should like \nto hear about the three swords,' said the king; and Kwang-dze went on, 'There is the sword \nof the Son of Heaven; the sword of a feudal prince; and the sword of a common man.'\n\n'What about the sword of the Son of Heaven?'\n\n'This sword has Yen-khî \nand Shih-khang \nfor its point; Khî and (Mount) Tâi for \nits edge; Zin and Wei for its back; Kâu and Sung for its hilt; Han and Wei for its sheath. \nIt is embraced by the wild tribes all around; it is wrapped up in the four seasons; it \nis bound round by the Sea of Po; \nand its girdle is the enduring hills. It is regulated \nby the five elements; its wielding is by means of Punishments and Kindness; its unsheathing \nis like that of\n\nthe Yin and Yang; it is held fast in the spring and summer; it is put in action in the \nautumn and winter. When it is thrust forward, there is nothing in front of it; when lifted \nup, there is nothing above it; when laid down, there is nothing below it; when wheeled \nround, there is nothing left on any side of it; above, it cleaves the floating clouds; \nand below, it penetrates to every division of the earth. Let this sword be once used, \nand the princes are all reformed, and the whole kingdom submits. This is the sword of \nthe Son of Heaven.'\n\nKing Wän looked lost in amazement, and said again, 'And what about the sword of a feudal \nlord?' (Kwang-dze) replied, 'This sword has wise and brave officers for its point; pure \nand disinterested officers for its edge; able and honourable officers for its back; loyal \nand sage officers for its hilt; valiant and eminent officers for its sheath. When this \nsword is thrust directly forward, as in the former case, there is nothing in front of \nit; when directed upwards, there is nothing above it; when laid down, there is nothing \nbelow it; when wheeled round, there is nothing on any side of it. Above, its law is taken \nfrom the round heaven, and is in accordance with the three luminaries; below, its law \nis taken from the square earth, and is in accordance with the four seasons; between, it \nis in harmony with the minds of the people, and in all the parts of the state there is \npeace. Let this sword be once used, and you seem to hear the crash of the thunder-peal. \nWithin\n\nthe four borders there are none who do not respectfully submit, and obey the orders of \nthe ruler. This is the sword of the feudal lord.'\n\n'And what about the sword of the common man?' asked the king (once more). (Kwang-dze) \nreplied, 'The sword of the common man (is wielded by) those who have their hair in a tangle, \nwith whiskers projecting out; who wear slouching caps with coarse and unornamented tassels, \nand have their coats cut short behind; who have staring eyes, and talk (only) about the \nhazards (of their game). They hit at one another before you. Above, the sword slashes \nthrough the neck; and below, it scoops out the liver and lungs. This is the sword of the \ncommon man. (The users of it) are not different from fighting cocks; any morning their \nlives are brought to an end; they are of no use in the affairs of the state. Your Majesty \noccupies the seat of the Son of Heaven, and that you should be so fond of the swordsmanship \nof such common men, is unworthy, as I venture to think, of your Majesty.'\n\nOn this the king drew Kwang-dze with him, and went up to the top of the hall, where the \ncook set forth a meal, which the king walked round three times (unable to sit down to \nit). Kwang-dze said to him, 'Sit down quietly, Great King, and calm yourself. I have said \nall I wished to say about swords.' King Wän, thereafter, did not quit the palace for three \nmonths, and the swordsmen all killed themselves in their own rooms.\n"

    "BOOK XXXI. YÜ-FÛ.": "\nConfucius, rambling in the forest of Dze-wei, stopped and sat down by the Apricot altar. \nThe disciples began to read their books, while he proceeded to play on his lute, singing \nas he did so. He had not half finished his ditty when an old fisherman stepped\n\ndown from his boat, and came towards them. His beard and eyebrows were turning white; \nhis hair was all uncombed; and his sleeves hung idly down. He walked thus up from the \nbank, till he got to the dry ground, when he stopped, and, with his left hand holding \none of his knees, and the right hand at his chin, listened. When the ditty was finished, \nhe beckoned to Dze-kung and Dze-lû, who both responded and went to him. Pointing to Confucius, \nhe said, 'Who is he?' Dze-lû replied, 'He is the Superior Man of Lû.' 'And of what family \nis he?' 'He is of the Khung family.' 'And what is the occupation of this Mr. Khung?' To \nthis question, Dze-la gave no reply, but Dze-kung replied, 'This scion of the Khung family \ndevotes himself in his own nature to leal-heartedness and sincerity; in his conduct he \nmanifests benevolence and righteousness; he cultivates the ornaments of ceremonies and \nmusic; he pays special attention to the relationships of society; above, he would promote \nloyalty to the hereditary lords; below, he seeks the transformation of all classes of \nthe people; his object being to benefit the kingdom:—this is what Mr. Khung devotes \nhimself to.'\n\nThe stranger further asked, 'Is he a ruler possessed of territory?' 'No,' was Sze-kung's \nreply. 'Is he the assistant of any prince or king?' 'No;' and on this the other began \nto laugh and to retrace his steps, saying as he went, 'Yes, benevolence is benevolence! \nBut I am afraid he will not escape (the evils incident to humanity). By embittering his \nmind and toiling his body, he is imperilling his true (nature)! Alas! how far removed \nis he from the proper way (of life)!'\n\nDze-kung returned, and reported (what the man had said) to Confucius, who pushed his lute \naside, and arose, saying, 'Is he not a sage?' and down the slope he went in search of \nhim. When he reached the edge of the lake, there was the fisherman with his pole, dragging \nthe boat towards him. Turning round and seeing Confucius, he came back towards him and \nstood up. Confucius then drew back, bowed to him twice, and went forward. 'What do you \nwant with me, Sir?' asked the stranger. The reply was, 'A little while ago, my Master, \nyou broke off the thread of your remarks and went away. Inferior to you, I do not know \nwhat you wished to say, and have ventured here to wait for your instructions, fortunate \nif I may but hear the sound of your words to complete the assistance that you can give \nme!' 'Ah!' responded the stranger, 'how great is your love of learning!'\n\nConfucius bowed twice, and then rose up, and said, 'Since I was young, I have cultivated \nlearning till I am now sixty-nine years old; but I have not had an opportunity of hearing \nthe perfect teaching;—dare I but listen to you with a humble and unprejudiced mind?' \nThe stranger replied, 'Like seeks to like, and (birds) of the same note respond to one \nanother;—this is a rule of Heaven. Allow me to explain what I am in possession of, \nand to pass over (from its standpoint) to the things which occupy you. What you occupy \nyourself with are the affairs of men. When the sovereign, the feudal lords, the great \nofficers, and the common people, these four classes, do what is correct (in their several \npositions), we have the beauty of good order; and when they leave their proper duties, \nthere ensues the greatest\n\ndisorder. When the officials attend to their duties, and the common people are anxiously \nconcerned about their business, there is no encroachment on one another's rights.\n\n'Fields running to waste; leaking rooms; insufficiency of food and clothing; taxes unprovided \nfor; want of harmony among wives and concubines; and want of order between old and young;—these \nare the troubles of the common people.\n\n'Incompetency for their charges; inattention to their official business; want of probity \nin conduct; carelessness and idleness in subordinates; failure of merit and excellence; \nand uncertainty of rank and emolument:—these are the troubles of great officers.\n\n'No loyal ministers at their courts; the clans in their states rebellious; want of skill \nin their mechanics; articles of tribute of bad quality; late appearances at court in spring \nand autumn; and the dissatisfaction of the sovereign:—these are the troubles of the \nfeudal lords.\n\n'Want of harmony between the Yin and Yang; unseasonableness of cold and heat, affecting \nall things injuriously; oppression and disorder among the feudal princes, their presuming \nto plunder and attack one another, to the injury of the people ceremonies and music ill-regulated; \nthe resources for expenditure exhausted or deficient; the social relationships uncared \nfor; and the people abandoned to licentious disorder:—these are the troubles of the \nSon of Heaven and his ministers.\n\n'Now, Sir, you have not the high rank of a ruler, a feudal lord, or a minister of the \nroyal court, nor are you in the inferior position of a great minister, with his departments \nof business, and yet you take\n\nit on you to regulate ceremonies and music, and to give special attention to the relationships \nof society, with a view to transform the various classes of the people:—is it not \nan excessive multiplication of your business?\n\n'And moreover men are liable to eight defects, and (the conduct of) affairs to four evils; \nof which we must by all means take account.\n\n'To take the management of affairs which do not concern him is called monopolising. To \nbring forward a subject which no one regards is called loquacity. To lead men on by speeches \nmade to please them is called sycophancy. To praise men without regard to right or wrong \nis called flattery. To be fond of speaking of men's wickedness is called calumny. To part \nfriends and separate relatives is called mischievousness. To praise a man deceitfully, \nor in the same way fix on him the character of being bad, is called depravity. Without \nreference to their being good or bad, to agree with men with double face, in order to \nsteal a knowledge of what they wish, is called being dangerous. Those eight defects produce \ndisorder among other men and injury to one's self. A superior man will not make a friend \nof one who has them, nor will an intelligent ruler make him his minister.\n\n'To speak of what I called the four evils:—To be fond of conducting great affairs, \nchanging and altering what is of long-standing, to obtain for one's self the reputation \nof meritorious service, is called ambition; to claim all wisdom and intrude into affairs, \nencroaching on the work of others, and representing it as one's own, is called greediness; \nto see his errors without changing them, and to go on\n\nmore resolutely in his own way when remonstrated with, is called obstinacy; when another \nagrees with himself, to approve of him, and, however good he may be, when he disagrees, \nto disapprove of him, is called boastful conceit. These are the four evils. When one can \nput away the eight defects, and allow no course to the four evils, he begins to be capable \nof being taught.'\n\nConfucius looked sorrowful and sighed. (Again) he bowed twice, and then rose up and said, \n'I was twice driven from Lû. I had to flee from Wei; the tree under which I rested was \ncut down in Sung; I was kept in a state of siege between Khän and Zhâi. I do not know \nwhat errors I had committed that I came to be misrepresented on these four occasions (and \nsuffered as I did).' The stranger looked grieved (at these words), changed countenance, \nand said, 'Very difficult it is, Sir, to make you understand. There was a man who was \nfrightened at his shadow and disliked to see his footsteps, so that he ran to escape from \nthem. But the more frequently he lifted his feet, the more numerous his footprints were; \nand however fast he ran, his shadow did not leave him. He thought he was going too slow, \nand ran on with all his speed without stopping, till his strength was exhausted and he \ndied. He did not know that, if he had stayed in a shady place, his shadow would have disappeared, \nand that if he had remained still, he would have lost his footprints:—his stupidity \nwas excessive! And you, Sir, exercise your judgment on the questions about benevolence \nand righteousness; you investigate the points where agreement and difference touch; you \nlook at the changes from\n\nmovement to rest and from rest to movement; you have mastered the rules of receiving and \ngiving; you have defined the feelings of liking and disliking; you have harmonised the \nlimits of joy and anger:—and yet you have hardly been able to escape (the troubles \nof which you speak). If you earnestly cultivated your own person, and carefully guarded \nyour (proper) truth, simply rendering to others what was due to them, then you would have \nescaped such entanglements. But now, when you do not cultivate your own person, and make \nthe cultivation of others your object, are you not occupying yourself with what is external?'\n\nConfucius with an air of sadness said, 'Allow me to ask what it is that you call my proper \nTruth.' The stranger replied, 'A man's proper Truth is pure sincerity in its highest degree;—without \nthis pure sincerity one cannot move others. Hence if one (only) forces himself to wail, \nhowever sadly he may do so, it is not (real) sorrow; if he forces himself to be angry, \nhowever he may seem to be severe, he excites no awe; if he forces himself to show affection, \nhowever he may smile, he awakens no harmonious reciprocation. True grief, without a sound, \nis yet sorrowful; true anger, without any demonstration, yet awakens awe; true affection, \nwithout a smile, yet produces a harmonious reciprocation. Given this truth within, it \nexercises a spiritual efficacy without, and this is why we count it so valuable. In our \nrelations with others, it appears according to the requirements of each case:—in \nthe service of parents, as gentle, filial duty; in the service of rulers, as loyalty and \nintegrity; in festive drinking, as pleasant enjoyment; in the performance\n\nof the mourning rites, as sadness and sorrow. In loyalty and integrity, good service is \nthe principal thing; in festive drinking, the enjoyment; in the mourning rites, the sorrow; \nin the service of parents, the giving them pleasure. The beauty of the service rendered \n(to a ruler) does not require that it always be performed in one way; the service of parents \nso as to give them pleasure takes no account of how it is done; the festive drinking which \nministers enjoyment does not depend on the appliances for it; the observance of the mourning \nrites with the proper sorrow asks no questions about the rites themselves. Rites are prescribed \nfor the practice of the common people; man's proper Truth is what he has received from \nHeaven, operating spontaneously, and unchangeable. Therefore the sages take their law \nfrom Heaven, and prize their (proper) Truth, without submitting to the restrictions of \ncustom. The stupid do the reverse of this. They are unable to take their law from Heaven, \nand are influenced by other men; they do not know how to prize the proper Truth (of their \nnature), but are under the dominion of ordinary things, and change according to the customs \n(around them):always, consequently, incomplete. Alas for you, Sir, that you were early \nsteeped in the hypocrisies of men, and have been so late in hearing about the Great Way!'\n\n(Once more), Confucius bowed twice (to the fisherman), then rose again, and said, 'That \nI have met you to-day is as if I had the happiness of getting to heaven. If you, Master, \nare not ashamed, but will let me be as your servant, and continue to teach me, let me \nventure to ask where your dwelling is. I will\n\nthen beg to receive your instructions there, and finish my learning of the Great Way.' \nThe stranger replied, 'I have heard the saying, \"If it be one with whom you can walk together, \ngo with him to the subtlest mysteries of the Tâo. If it be one with whom you cannot walk \ntogether and he do not know the Tâo, take care that you do not associate with him, and \nyou will yourself incur no responsibility.\" Do your utmost, Sir. I must leave you, I must \nleave you!' With this he shoved off his boat, and went away among the green reeds.\n\nYen Yüan (now) returned to the carriage, where Dze-la handed to him the strap; but Confucius \ndid not look round, (continuing where he was), till the wavelets, were stilled, and he \ndid not hear the sound of the pole, when at last he ventured to (return and) take his \nseat. Dze-lû, by his side in the carriage, asked him, saying, 'I have been your servant \nfor a long time, but I have never seen you, Master, treat another with the awe and reverence \nwhich you have now shown. I have seen you in the presence of a Lord of ten thousand chariots \nor a Ruler of a thousand, and they have never received you in a different audience-room, \nor treated you but with the courtesies due to an equal, while you have still carried yourself \nwith a reserved and haughty air; but to-day this old fisherman has stood erect in front \nof you with his pole in his hand, while you, bent from your loins in the form of a sounding-stone, \nwould bow twice before you answered him;—was not your reverence of him excessive? \nYour disciples will all think it strange in you, Master. Why did the old fisherman receive \nsuch homage from you?'\n\nConfucius leant forward on the cross-bar of the\n\ncarriage, heaved a sigh, and said, 'Difficult indeed is it to change you, O Yû! You have \nbeen trained in propriety and righteousness for long, and yet your servile and mean heart \nhas not been taken from you. Come nearer, that I may speak fully to you. If you meet one \nolder than yourself, and do not show him respect, you fail in propriety. If you see a \nman of superior wisdom and goodness, and do not honour him, you want the great characteristic \nof humanity. If that (fisherman) did not possess it in the highest degree, how could he \nmake others submit to him? And if their submission to him be not sincere, they do not \nattain to the truth (of their nature), and inflict a lasting injury on their persons. \nAlas! there is no greater calamity to man than the want of this characteristic; and you, \nO Yû, you alone, would take such want on yourself.\n\n'Moreover, the Tâo is the course by Which all things should proceed. For things to fail \nin this is death; to observe it, is life. To oppose it in practice is ruin; to conform \nit, is success. Therefore wherever the sagely man finds the Tâo, he honours it. And that \nold fisherman to-day might be said to possess it;—dared I presume not to show him \nreverence?'\n"

    "BOOK XXXII. LIEH YÜ-KHÂU.": "\n1. Lieh Yü-khâu had started to go to Khî, but came back when he was half-way to it. He \nmet Po-hwän Wû-zän, \nwho said, 'Why have you come back?' His reply was, 'I was frightened.' \n'What frightened you?' 'I went into ten soup-shops to get a meal. and in five of them \nthe soup was set before me before (I had paid for it).' 'But what was there in that \nto frighten you?' (Lieh-dze) said, 'Though the inward and true purpose be not set forth, \nthe body like a spy gives some bright display of it. And this outward demonstration overawes \nmen's minds, and makes men on light grounds treat one as noble or as aged, from which \nevil to him will be produced. Now vendors of soup supply their commodity simply as a matter \nof business, and however much they may dispose of, their profit is but little,\n\nand their power is but slight; and yet they treated me as I have said:—how much more \nwould the lord of ten thousand chariots do so! His body burdened with (the cares of his) \nkingdom, and his knowledge overtasked by its affairs, he would entrust those affairs to \nme, and exact from me the successful conduct (of its government). It was this which frightened \nme.' Po-hwän Wû-zän replied, 'Admirable perspicacity! But if you carry yourself as you \ndo, men will flock to you for protection.'\n\nNot long after, Po-hwän Wû-zän went (to visit Lieh-dze), and found the space outside his \ndoor full of shoes. \nThere he stood with his face to the north, holding his staff upright, \nand leaning his chin on it till the skin was wrinkled. After standing so for some time, \nand without saying a word, he was going away, when the door-keeper went in, and told \nLieh-dze. The latter (immediately) took up his shoes, and ran barefoot after the visitor. \nWhen he overtook him at the (outer) gate, he said, 'Since you, Sir, have come, are you \ngoing away without giving me some medicine?' The other replied, 'It is of no use. I \ndid tell you that men would flock to you, and they do indeed do so. It is not that you \ncan cause men to flock to you, but you cannot keep them from not so coming;—of what \nuse is (all my warning)? What influences them and makes them glad is the display of your \nextraordinary (qualities); but you must also be influenced\n\nin your turn, and your proper nature be shaken, and no warning can be addressed to you. \nThose who associate with you do not admonish you of this. The small words which they speak \nare poison to a man. You perceive it not; you understand it not;—how can you separate \nyourself from them?\n\n'The clever toil on, and the wise are sad. Those who are without ability seek for nothing. \nThey eat to the full, and wander idly about. They drift like a vessel loosed from its \nmoorings, and aimlessly wander about.'\n\n2. A man of Käng, called Hwan, learned his books in the neighbourhood of Khiû-shih, \nand in no longer time than three years became a Confucian scholar, benefiting the three \nclasses of his kindred \nas the Ho extends its enriching influence for nine lî. He made \nhis younger brother study (the principles of) Mo, and then they two—the scholar \nand the Mohist—disputed together (about their respective systems), and the father \ntook the side of the younger. \nAfter ten years Hwan killed himself. (By and by) he appeared \nto his father in a dream, saying, 'It was I who made your son become a\n\nMohist; why did you not recognise that good service? I am become (but) the fruit of \na cypress in autumn.' \nBut the Creator, \nin apportioning the awards of men, does not \nrecompense them for their own doings, but recompenses them for the (use of the) Heavenly \nin them. It was thus that Hwan's brother was led to learn Mohism. When this Hwan thought \nthat it was he who had made his brother different from what he would have been, and proceeded \nto despise his father, he was like the people of Khî, who, while they drank from a well, \ntried to keep one another from it. Hence it is said, 'Now-a-days all men are Hwans.' \nFrom this we perceive that those who possess the characteristics (of the Tâo) consider \nthat they do not know them; how much more is it so with those who possess the Tâo itself! \nThe ancients called such (as Hwan) 'men who had escaped the punishment of Heaven.'\n\n3. The sagely man rests in what is his proper rest; he does not rest in what is not so;—the \nmultitude of men rest in what is not their proper rest; they do not rest in their proper \nrest.\n\n4. Kwang-dze said, To know the Tâo is easy; not to say (that you know it) is difficult. \nTo know it and not to speak of it is the way to attain to the\n\nHeavenly; to know and to speak of it, is the way to show the Human. The ancients pursued \nthe Heavenly (belonging to them), and not the Human.'\n\n5. Kû Phing-man \nlearned how to slaughter the dragon from Kih-lî Yî, expending (in \ndoing so) all his wealth of a thousand ounces of silver. In three years he became perfect \nin the art, but he never exercised his skill.\n\n6. The sage looks on what is deemed necessary as unnecessary, and therefore is not at \nwar (in himself). \nThe mass of men deem what is unnecessary to be necessary, and therefore \nthey are often at war (in themselves). Therefore those who pursue this method of (internal) \nwar, resort to it in whatever they seek for. But reliance on such war leads to ruin.\n\n7. The wisdom of the small man does not go beyond (the minutiae of) making presents and \nwriting memoranda, wearying his spirits out in what is trivial and mean. But at the same \ntime he wishes to aid in guiding to (the secret of) the Tâo and of (all) things in the \nincorporeity of the Grand Unity. In this way he goes all astray in regard to (the mysteries \nof) space and time. The fetters of embodied matter keep him from the knowledge of the \nGrand Beginning. (On the other hand), the perfect man directs the energy of his spirit \nto what was before the Beginning, and finds pleasure in the mysteriousness\n\nbelonging to the region of nothingness. He is like the water which flows on without the \nobstruction of matter, and expands into the Grand Purity.\n\nAlas for what you do, (O men)! You occupy yourselves with things trivial as a hair, and \nremain ignorant of the Grand Rest!\n\n8. There was a man of Sung, called Zhâo Shang, who was sent by the king of Sung on a mission \nto Khin. On setting out, he had several carriages with him; and the king (of Khin) was \nso pleased with him that he gave him another hundred. When he returned to Sung, he saw \nKwang-dze, and said to him, 'To live in a narrow lane of a poor mean hamlet, wearing sandals \namid distress of poverty, with a weazen neck and yellow face;—that is what I should \nfind it difficult to do. But as soon as I come to an understanding with the Lord of a \nmyriad carriages, to find myself with a retinue of a hundred carriages,—that is wherein \nI excel.' Kwang-dze replied, 'When the king of Khän is ill, the doctor whom he calls to \nopen an ulcer or squeeze a boil receives a carriage; and he who licks his piles receives \nfive. The lower the service, the more are the carriages given. Did you, Sir, lick his \npiles? How else should you have got so many carriages? Begone!'\n\n9. Duke Âi of Lû asked Yen Ho, saying, 'If I employ Kung-nî as the support of my government, \nwill the evils of the state be thereby cured?' The\n\nreply was, '(Such a measure) would be perilous! It would be full of hazard! Kung-nî, moreover, \nwill try to ornament a feather and paint it; in the conduct of affairs he uses flowery \nspeeches. A (mere) branch is to him more admirable (than the root); he can bear to misrepresent \ntheir nature in instructing the people, and is not conscious of the unreality of his words. \nHe receives (his inspiration) from his own mind, and rules his course from his own spirit:—what \nfitness has he to be set over the people? Is such a man suitable for you (as your minister)? \nCould you give to him the nourishment (of the people)? You would do so by mistake (but \nnot on purpose, for a time, but not as a permanency). To make the people leave what is \nreal, and learn what is hypocritical—that is not the proper thing to be shown to \nthem; if you take thought for future ages, your better plan will be to give up (the idea \nof employing Confucius). What makes government difficult, is the dealing with men without \nforgetting yourself; this is not according to the example of Heaven in diffusing its benefits. \nMerchants and traffickers are not to be ranked (with administrative officers); if on an \noccasion you so rank them, the spirits (of the people) do not acquiesce in your doing \nso. The instruments of external punishment are made of metal and wood; those of internal \npunishment are agitation (of the mind) and (the sense of) transgression. When small men \nbecome subject to the external punishment, the (instruments of) metal and wood deal with \nthem; when they become liable to the internal punishments, the Yin and Yang consume\n\nthem. It is only the true man who can escape both from the external and internal punishment.'\n\n10. Confucius said, 'The minds of men are more difficult of approach than (the position \ndefended by) mountains and rivers, and more difficult to know than Heaven itself. Heaven \nhas its periods of spring and autumn, of winter and summer, and of morning and evening; \nbut man's exterior is thickly veiled, and his feelings lie deep. Thus the demeanour of \nsome is honest-like, and yet they go to excess (in what is mean); others are really gifted, \nand yet look to be without ability; some seem docile and impressible, but yet they have \nfar-reaching schemes; others look firm, and yet may be twisted about; others look slow, \nand yet they are hasty. In this way those who hasten to do what is right as if they were \nthirsty will anon hurry away from it as if it were fire. Hence the superior man looks \nat them when employed at a distance to test their fidelity, and when employed near at \nhand to test their reverence. By employing them on difficult services, he tests their \nability; by questioning them suddenly, he tests their knowledge; by appointing them a \nfixed time, he tests their good faith; by entrusting them with wealth, he tests their \nbenevolence; by telling them of danger, he tests their self-command in emergencies; by \nmaking them drunk, he tests their tendencies; by placing them in a variety of society, \nhe tests their chastity:—by these nine tests the inferior man is discovered.'\n\n11. When Khâo-fû, the Correct, \nreceived the first\n\ngrade of official rank, he walked with head bowed down; on receiving the second, with \nbent back; on receiving the third, with body stooping, he ran and hurried along the wall:—who \nwould presume not to take him as a model? But one of those ordinary men, on receiving \nhis first appointment, goes along with a haughty stride; on receiving his second, he looks \nquite elated in his chariot; and on receiving the third, he calls his uncles by their \npersonal names;—how very different from Hsü (Yû) in the time (of Yâo of) Thang!\n\nOf all things that injure (men) there is none greater than the practising of virtue with \nthe purpose of the mind, till the mind becomes supercilious. When it becomes so, the mind \n(only) looks inwards (on itself), and such looking into itself leads to its ruin. This \nevil quality has five forms, and the chief of them is that which is the central. What \ndo we mean by the central quality? It is that which appears in a man's loving (only) his \nown views, and reviling whatever he does not do (himself).\n\nLimiting (men's advance), there are eight extreme conditions; securing (that advance), \nthere are three things necessary; and the person has its six repositories. Elegance; a \n(fine) beard; tallness; size; strength; beauty; bravery; daring; and in all these excelling \nothers:—(these are the eight extreme conditions) by which advance is limited. Depending \non and copying others; stooping in order to rise; and being straitened by the fear of \nnot equalling others:—\n\nthese are the three things that lead to advancing. Knowledge seeking to reach to all that \nis external; bold movement producing many resentments; benevolence and righteousness leading \nto many requisitions; understanding the phenomena of life in an extraordinary degree; \nunderstanding all knowledge so as to possess an approach to it; understanding the great \ncondition appointed for him, and following it, and the smaller conditions, and meeting \nthem as they occur:—(these are the six repositories of the person).\n\n12. There was a man who, having had an interview with the king of Sung, and been presented \nby him with ten carriages, showed them boastfully to Kwang-dze, as if the latter had been \na boy. Kwang-dze said to him, 'Near the Ho there was a poor man who supported his family \nby weaving rushes (to form screens). His son, when diving in a deep pool, found a pearl \nworth a thousand ounces of silver. The father said, \"Bring a stone, and break it in pieces. \nA pearl of this value must have been in a pool nine khung deep, and under the chin \nof the Black Dragon. That you were able to get it must have been owing to your finding \nhim asleep. Let him awake, and the consequences to you will not be small!\" Now the kingdom \nof Sung is deeper than any pool of nine khung, and its king is fiercer than the Black \nDragon. That you were able to get the\n\nchariots must have been owing to your finding him asleep. Let him awake, and you will \nbe ground to powder.'\n\n13. Some (ruler) having sent a message of invitation to him, Kwang-sze replied to the \nmessenger, 'Have you seen, Sir, a sacrificial ox? It is robed with ornamental embroidery, \nand feasted on fresh grass and beans. But when it is led into the grand ancestral temple, \nthough it wished to be (again) a solitary calf, would that be possible for it?\n\n14. When Kwang-dze was about to die, his disciples signified their wish to give him a \ngrand burial. 'I shall have heaven and earth,' said he, 'for my coffin and its shell; \nthe sun and moon for my two round symbols of jade; the stars and constellations for my \npearls and jewels; and all things assisting as the mourners. Will not the provisions for \nmy burial be complete? What could you add to them?' The disciples replied, 'We are afraid \nthat the crows and kites will eat our master.' Kwang-dze rejoined, 'Above, the crows and \nkites will eat me; below, the mole-crickets and ants will eat me:—to take from those \nand give to these would only show your partiality.'\n\nThe attempt, with what is not even, to produce what is even will only produce an uneven \nresult; the attempt, with what is uncertain, to make the uncertain certain will leave \nthe uncertainty as it\n\nwas. He who uses only the sight of his eyes is acted on by what he sees; it is the (intuition \nof the) spirit, that gives the assurance of certainty. That the sight of the eyes is not \nequal to that intuition of the spirit is a thing long acknowledged. And yet stupid people \nrely on what they see, and will have it to be the sentiment of all men;—all their \nsuccess being with what is external:—is it not sad?\n"

    "BOOK XXXIII. THIEN HSIÂ.": "\n1. The methods employed in the regulation of the world are many; and (the employers \nof them) think each that the efficiency of his own method leaves nothing to be added to \nit.\n\nBut where is what was called of old 'the method of the Tâo?' We must reply, 'It is \neverywhere.' But then whence does the spiritual in it come down? and whence does the \nintelligence in it \ncome forth? There is that which gives birth to the Sage, and that \nwhich gives his perfection to the King:—the origin of both is the One.\n\nNot to be separate from his primal source constitutes what we call the Heavenly man; not \nto be separate from the essential nature thereof constitutes what we call the Spirit-like \nman; not to be separate from its real truth constitutes what we call the Perfect man.\n\nTo regard Heaven as his primal Source, Its Attributes as the Root (of his nature), and \nthe Tâo as the Gate (by which he enters into this inheritance), (knowing also) the prognostics \ngiven in change and transformation, constitutes what we call the Sagely man.\n\nTo regard benevolence as (the source of all) kindness, righteousness as (the source of \nall) distinctions, propriety as (the rule of) all conduct, and music as (the idea of) \nall harmony, thus diffusing a fragrance of gentleness and goodness, constitutes what we \ncall the Superior man.\n\nTo regard laws as assigning the different (social) conditions, their names as the outward \nexpression (of the social duties), the comparison of subjects as supplying the grounds \nof evidence, investigation as conducting to certainty, so that things can be numbered \nas first, second, third, fourth (and so on):—(this is the basis of government). Its \nhundred offices are thus arranged; business has its regular course; the great matters \nof clothes and food are provided for; cattle are fattened and looked after; the (government) \nstores are filled; the old and weak, orphans and solitaries, receive anxious consideration:—in \nall these ways is provision made for the nourishment of the people.\n\nHow complete was (the operation of the Tâo) in the men of old! It made them the equals \nof spiritual beings, and subtle and all-embracing as heaven and earth. They nourished \nall things, and produced\n\nharmony all under heaven. Their beneficent influence reached to all classes of the people. \nThey understood all fundamental principles, and followed them out to their graduated issues; \nin all the six directions went their penetration, and in the four quarters all things \nwere open to them. Great and small, fine and coarse;—all felt their presence and \noperation. Their intelligence, as seen in all their regulations, was handed down from \nage to age in their old laws, and much of it was still to be found in the Historians. \nWhat of it was in the Shih, the Shû, the Lî, and the Yo, might be learned from the scholars \nof Zâu \nand Lû', \nand the girdled members of the various courts. The Shih describes \nwhat should be the aim of the mind; the Shû, the course of events; the Lî is intended \nto direct the conduct; the Yo, to set forth harmony; the Yî, to show the action of the \nYin and Yang; and the Khun Khiû, to display names and the duties belonging to them.\n\nSome of the regulations (of these men of old), scattered all under heaven, and established \nin our Middle states, are (also) occasionally mentioned and described in the writings \nof the different schools.\n\nThere ensued great disorder in the world, and sages and worthies no longer shed their \nlight on it. The Tâo and its characteristics ceased to be regarded as uniform. Many in \ndifferent places got\n\none glimpse of it, and plumed themselves on possessing it as a whole. They might be compared \nto the ear, the eye, the nose, or the mouth. Each sense has its own faculty, but their \ndifferent faculties cannot be interchanged. So it was with the many branches of the various \nschools. Each had its peculiar excellence, and there was the time for the use of it; but \nnotwithstanding no one covered or extended over the whole (range of truth). The case was \nthat of the scholar of a corner who passes his judgment on all the beautiful in heaven \nand earth, discriminates the principles that underlie all things, and attempts to estimate \nthe success arrived at by the ancients. Seldom is it that such an one can embrace all \nthe beautiful in heaven and earth, or rightly estimate the ways of the spiritual and intelligent; \nand thus it was that the Tâo, which inwardly forms the sage and externally the king, \nbecame obscured and lost its clearness, became repressed and lost its development. Every \none in the world did whatever he wished, and was the rule to himself. Alas! the various \nschools held on their several ways, and could not come back to the same point, nor agree \ntogether. The students of that later age unfortunately did not see the undivided purity \nof heaven and earth, and the great scheme of truth held by the ancients. The system of \nthe Tâo was about to be torn in fragments all under the sky.\n\n2. To leave no example of extravagance to future generations; to show no wastefulness \nin the use of\n\nanything; to make no display in the degree of their (ceremonial) observances; to keep \nthemselves (in their expenditure) under the restraint of strict and exact rule, so as \nto be prepared for occurring emergencies;—such regulations formed part of the system \nof the Tâo in antiquity, and were appreciated by Mo Tî, and (his disciple) Khin Hwa-lî. \nWhen they heard of such ways, they were delighted with them; but they enjoined them in \nexcess, and followed them themselves too strictly. (Mo) made the treatise 'Against Music,' \nand enjoined the subject of another, called 'Economy in Expenditure,' on his followers. \nHe would have no singing in life, and no wearing of mourning on occasions of death. He \ninculcated Universal Love, and a Common Participation in all advantages, and condemned \nFighting. His doctrine did not admit of Anger. He was fond also of Learning, and with \nit all strove not to appear different from others. Yet he did not agree with the former \nkings, but attacked the ceremonies and music of the ancients.\n\nHwang-Tî had his Hsien-khih; Yâo, his Tâ Kang; Shun, his Tâ Shâo; Yü, his Tâ Hsiâ; Thang, \nhis Tâ Hû; king Wän, his music of the Phi-yung; and king Wû and the duke of Kâu made \nthe Wû.\n\nIn the mourning rites of the ancients, the noble and mean had their several observances, \nthe high and low their different degrees. The coffin of the Son of Heaven was sevenfold; \nof a feudal lord, fivefold; of a great officer, threefold; of other officers, twofold. \nBut now Mo-dze alone, would have no singing during life, and no wearing of mourning after \ndeath. As the rule for all, he would have a coffin of elaeococca wood, three inches thick, \nand without any enclosing shell. The teaching of such lessons cannot be regarded as affording \na proof of his love for men; his practising them in his own case would certainly show \nthat he did not love himself; but this has not been sufficient to overthrow the views \nof Mo-dze. Notwithstanding, men will sing, and he condemns singing; men will wail, and \nhe condemns wailing; men will express their joy, and he condemns such expression:—is \nthis truly in accordance with man's nature? Through life toil, and at death niggardliness:—his \nway is one of great unkindliness. Causing men sorrow and melancholy, and difficult to \nbe carried into practice, I fear it cannot be regarded as the way of a sage. Contrary \nto the minds of men everywhere, men will not endure it. Though Mo-dze himself might be \nable to endure it, how can the aversion of the world to it be overcome? The world averse \nto it, it must be far from the way of the (ancient) kings.\n\nMo-dze, in praise of his views, said, 'Anciently, when Yü was draining off the waters \nof the flood, he set free the channels of the Kiang and the Ho, and opened communications \nwith them from the\n\nregions of the four Î and the nine provinces. The famous hills with which he dealt were \n300, the branch streams were 3000, and the smaller ones innumerable. With his own hands \nhe carried the sack and wielded the spade, till he had united all the streams of the country \n(conducting them to the sea). There was no hair left on his legs from the knee to the \nankle. He bathed his hair in the violent wind, and combed it in the pelting rain, thus \nmarking out the myriad states. Yü was a great sage, and thus he toiled in the service \nof the world.' The effect of this is that in this later time most of the Mohists wear \nskins and dolychos cloth, with shoes of wood or twisted hemp, not stopping day or night, \nbut considering such toiling on their part as their highest achievement. They say that \nhe who cannot do this is acting contrary to the way of Yü, and not fit to be a Mohist.\n\nThe disciples of Khin of Hsiang-lî, the followers of the various feudal lords; and \nMohists of the south, such as Khû Hu, Ki Khih, \nand Täng Ling-dze, all repeated \nthe texts of Mo, but they differed in the objections which they offered to them, and in \ntheir deceitful glosses they called one another Mohists of different schools. They had \ntheir disputations, turning on 'what was hard,' and 'what was white,' what constituted \n'sameness' and what 'difference,' and their expressions about the difference between 'the \nodd' and the even,' with which they answered one another. They regarded\n\ntheir most distinguished member as a sage, and wished to make him their chief, hoping \nthat he would be handed down as such to future ages. To the present day these controversies \nare not determined.\n\nThe idea of Mo Tî and Khin Hwa-lî was good, but their practice was wrong. They would have \nmade the Mohists of future ages feel it necessary to toil themselves, till there was not \na hair on their legs, and still be urging one another on; (thus producing a condition) \nsuperior indeed to disorder, but inferior to the result of good government. Nevertheless, \nMo-dze was indeed one of the best men in the world, which you may search without finding \nhis equal. Decayed and worn (his person) might be, but he is not to be rejected,—a \nscholar of ability indeed!\n\n3. To keep from being entangled by prevailing customs; to shun all ornamental attractions \nin one's self; not to be reckless in his conduct to others; not to set himself stubbornly \nagainst a multitude; to desire the peace and repose of the world in order to preserve \nthe lives of the people; and to cease his action when enough had been obtained for the \nnourishment of others and himself, showing that this was the aim of his mind;—such \na scheme belonged to the system of the Tâo in antiquity, and it was appreciated by Sung Hsing and Yin Wän.\n\nWhen they heard of such ways, they were delighted with them. They made the Hwa-shan cap, \nand wore it as their distinguishing badge. In their intercourse with others, whatever \ntheir differences might be, they began by being indulgent to them. Their name for 'the \nForbearance of the Mind' was 'the Action of the Mind.' By the warmth of affection they \nsought the harmony of joy, and to blend together all within the four seas; and their wish \nwas to plant this everywhere as the chief thing to be pursued. They endured insult without \nfeeling it a disgrace; they sought to save the people from fighting; they forbade aggression \nand sought to hush the weapons of strife, to save their age from war. In this way they \nwent everywhere, counselling the high and instructing the low. Though the world might \nnot receive them, they only insisted on their object the more strongly, and would not \nabandon it. Hence it is said, 'The high and the low might be weary of them, but they were \nstrong to show themselves.'\n\nNotwithstanding all this, they acted too much out of regard to others, and too little \nfor themselves. It was as if they said, 'What we request and wish is simply that there \nmay be set down for us five pints of rice;—that will be enough.' But I fear the Master \nwould not get his fill from this; and the disciples, though famishing, would still have \nto be mindful of the world, and, never stopping day or night, have to say, 'Is it necessary \nI should preserve\n\nmy life? Shall I scheme how to exalt myself above the master, the saviour of the age?'\n\nIt was moreover as if they said, 'The superior man does not censoriously scrutinize (the \nfaults of others); he does not borrow from others to supersede his own endeavours; when \nany think that he is of no use to the world, he knows that their intelligence is inferior \nto his own; he considers the prohibition of aggression and causing the disuse of arms \nto be an external achievement, and the making his own desires to be few and slight to \nbe the internal triumph.' Such was their discrimination between the great and the small, \nthe subtle and the coarse; and with the attainment of this they stopped.\n\n4. Public-spirited, and with nothing of the partizan; easy and compliant, without any \nselfish partialities; capable of being led, without any positive tendencies; following \nin the wake of others, without any double mind; not looking round because of anxious thoughts; \nnot scheming in the exercise of their wisdom; not choosing between parties, but going \nalong with all;—all such courses belonged to the Tâoists of antiquity, and they were \nappreciated by Phäng Mäng, \nThien Phien, and Shän Tâo. When they heard of such \nways, they were delighted with them. They considered that the first thing for them to \ndo was to adjust the controversies about different things. They said, 'Heaven can cover, \nbut it cannot sustain; Earth can contain, but it cannot\n\ncover. The Great Tâo embraces all things, but It does not discriminate between them.'\n\nThey knew that all things have what they can do and what they cannot do. Hence it is said, \n'If you select, you do not reach all; if you teach some things, you must omit the others; \nbut the Tâo neglects none.' Therefore Shän Tâo discarded his knowledge and also all thought \nof himself, acting only where he had no alternative, and pursued it as his course to be \nindifferent and pure in his dealings with others. He said that the best knowledge was \nto have no knowledge, and that if we had a little knowledge it was likely to prove a dangerous \nthing. Conscious of his unfitness, he undertook no charge, and laughed at those who valued \nability and virtue. Remiss and evasive, he did nothing, and disallowed the greatest sages \nwhich the world had known. Now with a hammer, now with his hand, smoothing all corners, \nand breaking all bonds, he accommodated himself to all conditions. He disregarded right \nand wrong, his only concern being to avoid trouble; he learned nothing from the wise and \nthoughtful, and took no note of the succession of events, thinking only of carrying himself \nwith a lofty disregard of everything. He went where he was pushed, and followed where \nhe was led, like a whirling wind, like a feather tossed about, like the revolutions of \na grindstone.\n\nWhat was the reason that he appeared thus complete, doing nothing wrong? that, whether \nin motion or at rest, he committed no error, and could be charged with no transgression? \nCreatures that have no knowledge are free from the troubles that arise from self-assertion \nand the entanglements that spring from the use of knowledge. Moving and at\n\nrest) they do not depart from their proper course, and all their life long they do not \nreceive any praise. Hence (Shän Tâo) said, 'Let me come to be like a creature without \nknowledge. Of what use are the (teachings of the) sages and worthies?' But a clod of earth \nnever fails in the course (proper for it), and men of spirit and eminence laughed together \nat him, and said, 'The way of Shän Tâo does not describe the conduct of living men; that \nit should be predicable only of the dead is strange indeed!'\n\nIt was just the same with Thien Phien. He learned under Phäng Mäng, but it was as if he \nwere not taught at all. The master of Phäng Mäng said, 'The Tâoist professors of old came \nno farther than to say that nothing was absolutely right and nothing absolutely wrong.' \nHis spirit was like the breath of an opposing wind; how can it be described in words? \nBut he was always contrary to (the views of) other men, which he would not bring together \nto view, and he did not escape shaving the corners and bonds (of which I have spoken). \nWhat he called the Tâo was not the true Tâo, and what he called the right was really the \nwrong\n\nPhäng Mäng, Thien Phien, and Shin Tâo did not in fact know the Tâo; but nevertheless they \nhad heard in a general way about it.\n\n5. To take the root (from which things spring) as the essential (part), and the things \nas its coarse (embodiment); to see deficiency in accumulation; and in the solitude of \none's individuality to dwell with the spirit-like and intelligent;—such a course \nbelonged to the Tâo of antiquity, and it was appreciated\n\nby Kwan Yin \nand Lâo Tan. \nWhen they heard of such ways, they were delighted with \nthem. They built their system on the assumption of an eternal non-existence, and made \nthe ruling idea in it that of the Grand Unity. They made weakness and humility their mark \nof distinction, and considered that by empty vacuity no injury could be sustained, but \nall things be preserved in their substantiality.\n\nKwan Yin says, 'To him who does \nnot dwell in himself the forms of things show themselves \nas they are. His movement is like that of water; his stillness is like that of a mirror; \nhis response is like that of the echo. His tenuity makes him seem to be disappearing altogether; \nhe is still as a clear (lake), harmonious in his association with others, and he counts \ngain as loss. He does not take precedence of others, but follows them.' Lâo Tan says, \n'He knows his masculine power, but maintains his female weakness,—becoming the channel \ninto which all streams flow. He knows his white purity, but keeps his disgrace,—becoming \nthe valley of the world. Men all prefer to be first; he alone chooses to be last, saying, \n\"I will receive the offscourings of the world.\" Men all choose fulness; he alone chooses \nemptiness. He does not store, and therefore he has a superabundance; he looks solitary, \nbut has a multitude around him. In his conducting\n\nof himself he is easy and leisurely and wastes nothing. He does nothing, and laughs at \nthe clever and ingenious. Men all seek for happiness, but he feels complete in his imperfect \ncondition, and says, \"Let me only escape blame.\" He regards what is deepest as his root, \nand what is most restrictive as his rule; and says, \"The strong is broken; the sharp and \npointed is blunted.\" \nHe is always generous and forbearing with others, and does not \nencroach on any man;—this may be pronounced the height (of perfection).'\n\nO Kwan Yin, and Lâo Tan, ye were among the greatest men of antiquity; True men indeed!\n\n6. That the shadowy and still is without bodily form; that change and transformation are \never proceeding, but incapable of being determined. What is death? What is life? What \nis meant by the union of Heaven and Earth? Does the spiritual intelligence go away? Shadowy, \nwhere does it go? Subtle, whither does it proceed? All things being arranged as they are, \nthere is no one place which can be fitly ascribed to it. Such were the questions belonging \nto the scheme of Tâo in antiquity, and they were appreciated by Kwang Kâu. When he heard \nof such subjects, he was delighted with them. (He discussed them), using strange and mystical \nexpressions, wild and extravagant words, and phrases to which no definite meaning could \nbe assigned. He constantly indulged his own wayward ideas, but did not make himself a \npartisan, nor look at them as peculiar to himself. Considering that men were\n\nsunk in stupidity and could not be talked to in dignified style, he employed the words \nof the cup of endless application, with important quotations to substantiate the truth, \nand an abundance of corroborative illustrations. He chiefly cared to occupy himself with \nthe spirit-like operation of heaven and earth, and did not try to rise above the myriads \nof things. He did not condemn the agreements and differences of others, so that he might \nlive in peace with the prevalent views. Though his writings may seem to be sparkling trifles, \nthere is no harm in amusing one's self with them; though his phraseology be ever-varying, \nits turns and changes are worth being looked at;—the fulness and completeness of \nhis ideas cannot be exhausted. Above he seeks delight in the Maker; below, he has a friendly \nregard to those who consider life and death as having neither beginning nor end. As regards \nhis dealing with the Root (origin of all things), he is comprehensive and great, opening \nup new views, deep, vast, and free. As regards the Author and Master (the Great Tâo Itself), \nhe may be pronounced exact and correct, carrying our thoughts to range and play on high. \nNevertheless on the subject of transformation, and the emancipation of that from (the \nthraldom of) things, his principles are inexhaustible, and are not derived from his predecessors. \nThey are subtle and obscure, and cannot be fully explained.\n\n7. Hui Shih \nhad many ingenious notions. His writings would fill five carriages; but \nhis doctrines were erroneous and contradictory, and his words were wide of their mark. \nTaking up one thing after another, he would say:—'That which is so great that there \nis nothing outside it may be called the Great One; and that which is so small that there \nis nothing inside it may be called the Small One.' 'What has no thickness and will not \nadmit of being repeated is 1000 lî in size.' 'Heaven may be as low as the earth.' 'A \nmountain may be as level as a marsh.' 'The sun in the meridian may be the sun declining.' \n'A creature may be born to life and may die at the same time.' '(When it is said that) \nthings greatly alike are different from things a little alike, this is what is called \nmaking little of agreements and differences; (when it is said that) all things are entirely \nalike or entirely different, this is what is called making much of agreements and differences.' \n'The south is unlimited and yet has a limit.' 'I proceed to Yueh to-day and came to it \nyesterday.' 'Things which are joined together can be separated.' 'I know the centre of \nthe world;—it is north of Yen or south of Yueh.' 'If all things be regarded with \nlove, heaven and earth are of one body (with me).'\n\nHui Shih by such sayings as these made himself\n\nvery conspicuous throughout the kingdom, and was considered an able debater. All other \ndebaters vied with one another and delighted in similar exhibitions. (They would say), \n'There are feathers in an egg.' 'A fowl has three feet.' 'The kingdom belongs to Ying.' \n'A dog might have been (called) a sheep.' 'A tadpole has a tail.' 'Fire is not hot.' 'A \nmountain gives forth a voice.' 'A wheel does not tread on the ground.' 'The eye does not \nsee.' 'The finger indicates, but needs not touch, (the object).' 'Where you come to may \nnot be the end.' 'The tortoise is longer than the snake.' 'The carpenter's square is not \nsquare.' 'A compass should not itself be round.' 'A chisel does not surround its handle.' \n'The shadow of a flying bird does not (itself) move.' 'Swift as the arrowhead is, there \nis a time when it is neither flying nor at rest.' 'A dog is not a hound.' 'A bay horse \nand a black ox are three.' 'A white dog is black.' 'A motherless colt never had a mother.' \n'If from a stick a foot long you every day take the half of it, in a myriad ages it will \nnot be exhausted.'—It was in this way that the debaters responded to Hui Shih, all \ntheir lifetime, without coming to an end.\n\nHwan Twan \nand Kung-sun Lung \nwere true members of this class. By their specious representations \nthey threw a glamour over men's minds and altered their ideas. They vanquished men in \nargument, but could not subdue their minds, only keeping them in the enclosure of their \nsophistry. Hui Shih daily used his own knowledge and the arguments of others to propose \nstrange theses to all debaters\n\nsuch was his practice. At the same time he would talk freely of himself, thinking himself \nthe ablest among them, and saying, 'In heaven or earth who is my match?' Shih maintained \nindeed his masculine energy, but he had not the art (of controversy).\n\nIn the south there was a man of extraordinary views, named Hwang Liâo, who asked him \nhow it was that the sky did not fall nor the earth sink, and what was the cause of wind, \nrain, and the thunder's roll and crash. Shih made no attempt to evade the questions, and \nanswered him without any exercise of thought, talking about all things, without pause, \non and on without end; yet still thinking that his words were few, and adding to them \nthe strangest observations. He thought that to contradict others was a real triumph, and \nwished to make himself famous by overcoming them; and on this account he was not liked \nby the multitude of debaters. He was weak in real attainment, though he might seem strong \nin comparison with others, and his way was narrow and dark. If we look at Hui Shih's ability \nfrom the standpoint of Heaven and Earth, it was only like the restless activity of a mosquito \nor gadfly; of what service was it to anything? To give its full development to any one \ncapacity is a good thing, and he who does so is in the way to a higher estimation of the \nTâo; but Hui Shih could find no rest for himself in doing this. He diffused himself over \nthe world of things without satiety, till in the end he had only the reputation of being \na skilful debater. Alas! Hui Shih, with\n\nall his talents, vast as they were, made nothing out; he pursued all subjects and never \ncame back (with success). It was like silencing an echo by his shouting, or running a \nrace with his shadow. Alas!\n"
